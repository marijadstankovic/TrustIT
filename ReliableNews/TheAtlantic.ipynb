      "Since it first appeared in Wuhan, China, late last year, a newly discovered coronavirus has sickened more than 9,800 people, killed at least 213, caused a run on face masks, and shut down travel throughout China. All this has happened, and the virus still doesn’t have an official name.The virus’s temporary designation—2019-nCoV—is neither catchy nor pithy. Headlines routinely refer to this virus as the “Wuhan coronavirus” or even just “Chinese virus.” But those names tie the virus to particular places, going against current best practices. Often, the virus is called, simply, “coronavirus,” a broad term that includes many viruses other than this one. In the middle of an outbreak, picking a name might not seem like the most pressing problem, but whatever name that’s chosen—or sticks to the virus unofficially—can ultimately have lingering effects.In the 20th century, virus hunters frequently named their discoveries according to geography: Spanish flu; Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever; Lyme, for the town in Connecticut; Ebola, for a nearby river. These names forever bound these locales to diseases that may or may not have actually originated there. In 2009, “swine flu” led Egypt to slaughter all of its pigs, even though that virus was not spread through swine. The National Pork Board in the U.S. hated the name too.\n",

      "DES MOINES, Iowa—For a few nights every four years, the hotel bar at this downtown Marriott becomes the hottest spot in American politics. And sure enough, J. D. Scholten, a Democrat who is making his second run for the House seat held since 2003 by the anti-immigrant Republican Steve King, spent part of last night here.At this point, with the first votes of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary just days away, Iowa is also a place where Scholten couldn’t get through a podcast interview without Elizabeth Warren calling him.“We’ve been playing phone tag all day,” he told me, and declined the call. (They connected later.)Scholten has appeared with many of the presidential candidates, but the only way journalists will find out who he’s backing is by driving out to the rural, low-cell-service area where he’ll help run a caucus site Monday night.A peculiar mix of insider and outsider, Scholten was the perfect guest for the inaugural episode of The Ticket: Politics From The Atlantic, the relaunched podcast I’ll be hosting over the course of this crazy election year.Subscribe to The Ticket: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher (How to Listen)This transcript has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n",

      "This story contains spoilers for the series finale of The Good Place.Technically, The Good Place, NBC’s free-wheeling sitcom about the afterlife, ended its run last night. The hour-long series finale tied up loose plot threads, celebrated its characters’ relationships with one another, and dropped some heartening twists. For any show, even one as esoteric as The Good Place, hitting these benchmarks alone would make for a successful departure. But the comedy’s most salient philosophical takeaway resists this neat formula of linearity. Or, as the former “Arizona dirtbag” protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop (played by Kristen Bell) finally comes to understand, “Working out the terms of moral justification is an unending task.”The Good Place has spent four seasons asking weighty questions about the vexing condition of being alive: Can human beings become better? If so, how and what does that even mean? The high-concept series from Parks and Recreation creator Michael Schur began as a screwball comedy with some ethical musings threaded into its zany hijinks. For every invocation of Aristotelian theory, there was a giant shrimp flying around on-screen or a joke about the former Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles. The sitcom’s commitment to its dual mandates never wavered, but its finale still exhibits a surprising level of care—for the show’s ragtag crew of dead characters, to be sure, but also for its viewers, who will presumably be stuck figuring out this whole “existing as a human” thing for a bit longer. Nowhere is this more evident than in the episode’s clear-eyed approach to life’s final question: The Good Place concludes that human experiences are meaningful precisely because of our mortality—and how we treat one another in that finite window is the greatest measure of our lives.\n",

      "This article contains spoilers through the series finale of  The Good Place.The architects of The Good Place are two men named Michael. One, played by Ted Danson, is a demon in a skin suit whose job is to devise preposterous and subtly cruel scenarios with which to provoke maximum silliness among the four oddball characters in his care. The other is Michael Schur, The Good Place’s creator and showrunner, whose job is to devise preposterous and subtly cruel scenarios with which to provoke maximum silliness among the four oddball characters in his care. And both reveal themselves as having an ulterior motive in the end: the desire to create something fundamentally meaningful, something that maybe has the capacity to alter the people who experience it for the better.TV shows exist for a lot of reasons, very few of them high-minded and none entirely divorced from a framework that demands both viewership and profit. And yet the superlative ones try to do something else, too—to slightly influence the ways in which the people watching them understand the world, and one another. No recent series has done this as transparently as The Good Place. The NBC sitcom disguised itself as one thing (a comedy about a woman who accidentally got into heaven) before revealing that it was actually something else: a comedic appraisal of philosophy, morality, and the meaning of life. All of this was made palatable to network TV viewers with the help of winning stars, joyful puns and in-jokes about Blake Bortles, and a lightness of tone that kept things defiantly frivolous.\n",
      "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/01/taylor-swift-adulthood-blues-netflix-miss-americana/605758/\n",
      "What fans will hunger to know, after watching the new Netflix documentary Miss Americana, is whether Taylor Swift prefers carnitas or carne asada. “Do you eat burritos?” Swift asks her producer, Joel Little, at one point in the movie. Little giggles and asks who on Earth doesn’t eat burritos. Swift answers that she didn’t until two years prior—“I just had never tried one.” Cut to her inserting a chip into a thermos-size mass of tortilla as she discusses her anxieties about soon turning 29.That Swift lived for two and a half decades without experiencing a Chipotle coma is one of the more concrete revelations of Miss Americana, a stirring work of image correction. The director Lana Wilson, notable for her cinematic journalism about abortion and suicide, applies a vérité filter to Swift Inc. at a moment of transition for the now 30-year-old pop star. Wilson recaps Swift’s songwriting and scandals elegantly, with an emphasis on the star’s growing political consciousness. But mostly, the doc spins a fable about Swift loosening up from singing marionette to burrito-scarfing Real Girl. It’s a story packaged as triumphant, but it arrives at an awkward moment in Swift’s career and hints at an ambivalent truth: Adulthood can land like a minor chord, and self-actualization does not organize life so much as open new, messier possibilities.\n",

      "John Delaney ends the presidential campaign more or less the way he started it: in obscurity and in Iowa.This morning, three days before the Iowa caucus, the former representative from Maryland announced that he is leaving the presidential race. He had spent much of his time and energy during his 918-day campaign on the ground in the Hawkeye State, hoping to inspire grassroots excitement. It didn’t work.Delaney was the first candidate to enter the race, in July 2017, and he outlasted many of the other long shots in the Democratic field—as well as a few candidates who seemed to have more promise, like Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Delaney never achieved the popularity of Harris or Booker—the RealClearPolitics average places him at the very back of the pack, behind even Michael Bennet and Deval Patrick—and you’d be forgiven for not realizing he was still in the race. Once Delaney dropped off the debate stage, he basically disappeared from national coverage.“I leave this race with a profound sense of gratitude to the voters who shared with me their hopes and concerns for our magnificent country, in admiration for the other contenders for the nomination and proud of the work we did to change the debate,” Delaney said in a statement.The claim of changing the debate is dubious, but Delaney’s central intuition that Democratic primary voters were interested in moderation has proved largely correct. Earlier in the campaign, that view seemed quaint. Not only were Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders major contenders, but even moderates like Booker and Harris were edging leftward, embracing concepts such as Medicare for All. While some Democrats worried that unabashed progressives would struggle in a general election, the consensus was that primary voters demanded a more left-leaning party.Delaney was a gadfly in early debates, pouring cold water on proposals for big government-spending programs, especially on health care: The people wouldn’t pay for them, Delaney argued, and even if they did, they wouldn’t work. Because of his willingness to tut-tut his rivals, debate moderators loved Delaney and gave him disproportionate TV time; Warren used him as a foil, too. But eventually he faded, in part because he wasn’t as interesting as some of the other also-rans (hello, Marianne Williamson; ¿como estás, Beto?), no matter how swole he got.As Delaney fell behind, however, his political orientation survived and thrived. Sanders is in a strong position as the Iowa caucus approaches, but there’s little denying a moderate appetite among many Democrats. Joe Biden remains the national front-runner, and he has staked out a more centrist approach, especially on health care. So has Pete Buttigieg, another moderate standard-bearer near the top of the race. Warren has toned down her health-care talking points but faded anyway. Michael Bloomberg is surging, and while his politics are idiosyncratic, as Delaney did, he is running on a fiscally conservative platform.Delaney wasn’t the moderate savior he’d hoped to be, but he may turn out to have been something of a harbinger who brought prophecies of a moderate resurgence. If he couldn’t turn that into popularity, well, no prophet is accepted in his hometown—or in Iowa, apparently.As the primaries progress, this cheat sheet will be updated regularly.Who is he?\n",
      "The billionaire former mayor of New York, Bloomberg is a Democrat turned Republican turned independent turned Democrat again.Is he running?\n",
      "Yes. Having ruled out a run in March, hizzoner changed his mind in early November and officially launched his campaign on November 24.Why does he want to run?\n",
      "For starters, he is convinced that he’d be better and more competent at the job than anyone else. Bloomberg’s bid will likely center on his pet issues of gun control, climate change, and fighting the more fiscally liberal wing of the Democratic Party tooth and silver-plated nail.Who wants him to run?\n",
      "What, is his considerable ego not enough? Though his tenure as mayor is generally well regarded, it’s unclear what Bloomberg’s Democratic constituency is beyond other wealthy, socially liberal, and fiscally conservative types, and it’s not as if he needs their money to run.Can he win the nomination?\n",
      "Probably not. Bloomberg previously toyed with an independent run, but said that would only help Trump in 2020.Who is he?\n",
      "Patrick was governor of Massachusetts from 2007 to 2015, after serving in a top role in Bill Clinton’s Justice Department. More recently, he’s worked at Bain Capital.Is he running?\n",
      "Yes. Patrick officially entered the race on November 14.Why does he want to run?\n",
      "To be president, of course. But having passed on a run earlier, Patrick reconsidered because of worries that no one in the Democratic field has strong momentum and can unite the party.Who wants him to run?\n",
      "There’s an appetite for new candidates among some in the Democratic donor class, though there’s little sign that voters are so eager. Patrick is close to Barack Obama, but the former president has stayed out of the primary.Can he win?\n",
      "We’re not saying that a former Massachusetts governor and Bain employee can’t win the presidency, but recent history isn’t encouraging. But take it from Patrick: “I recognize running for president is a Hail Mary under any circumstances. This is a Hail Mary from two stadiums over.”What else do we know?\n",
      "Patrick’s estranged father played in the alien jazz great Sun Ra’s Arkestra.Who is he?\n",
      "A retired California hedge-funder, Steyer has poured his fortune into political advocacy on climate change and flirted with running for office.Is he running?No. He announced on January 9 that he would sit the race out. Lol jk! Steyer decided to get back into the race on July 9 after all.Why does he want to run?Impeachment, baby.Who wants him to run?\n",
      "There must be some #Resistance faction out there that does.Can he win the nomination?\n",
      "Nope.Who is he?\n",
      "The Coloradan was appointed to the Senate in 2009 and has since won reelection twice.Is he running?\n",
      "Yes. Bennet announced his campaign on May 2.Why does he want to run?\n",
      "Like his fellow Rocky Mountain State Democrat John Hickenlooper, Bennet presents himself as someone with experience in business and management who knows how to work with Republicans.Who wants him to run?\n",
      "Probably some of the same people who wanted Hickenlooper to run. Bennet gained new fans with a viral video of his impassioned rant about Ted Cruz during the January government shutdown.Can he win?\n",

      "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/01/isaac-asimovs-throwback-literary-legacy/605815/\n",
      "When Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy won the Hugo Award for best all-time science-fiction series, in 1966, no one was more surprised than the author. The books contained “no action,” Asimov complained years later, adding, “I kept waiting for something to happen, and nothing ever did.” As a young reader, I devoured the Foundation books, the short-story collection I, Robot, and other works by Asimov. Though these tales entranced me with their bold strokes of imagination, when I revisit them as an adult, their flaws stand out more than their virtues. It’s not so much that nothing happens, but that the reader doesn’t get to see anything happen. Asimov’s stories are dialogue-driven; the action happens off-stage while men (and, less frequently, women) huddle to debate the significance of what occurred or what ought to be done in the best Socratic fashion.Asimov was aware of these quirks. “I don’t see things when I write,” he once apologized. “I hear, and for the most part, what my characters talk about are ideas.” Still, his stories often evoke the smoke-filled corporate boardrooms of the past century more than a progressive tomorrow. And his writing is striking for its optimism, betraying a faith in technology and humanity that seems especially naive and out of place today. When considering Asimov’s tales now, I’m reminded of what another famous science-fiction author, Neil Gaiman, once cautioned about rereading older works in the genre: “Nothing dates harder and faster and more strangely than the future.” (It doesn’t help Asimov’s case that he was known for groping women, an aspect of the author’s legacy that Alec Nevala-Lee wrote about in depth for Public Books earlier this month.)\n"

      "Just four years ago, the GOP’s leaders were almost uniformly reacting to Trump with horror. Today, Republican officeholders have made their calculation: They will either go down with President Donald Trump, or they will rise with him.The GOP has in recent years been the more disciplined of America’s two major political parties, and although Trump likes to complain that his fellow Republicans aren’t as regimented as Democrats, the Senate impeachment trial shows otherwise.We won’t know until this evening exactly how many Republicans will vote in favor of witnesses in the Senate—whether Mitt Romney and Susan Collins will be joined by Lisa Murkowski, in other words—but Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is now confident he has the votes to defeat witnesses. That vote is now just a way station on the road to Trump’s inevitable acquittal, which could come as soon as tonight.That outcome will be the latest evidence of Trump’s unshakable hold over the Republican Party. If there were a group of GOP officials who might still resist the president’s style and approach, it might have been found in the Senate. Senators are temperamentally institutional, jealous of their own prerogatives, and comparatively insulated from the most intense electoral demands on other officeholders. In the end, though, GOP senators got in line.\n",

      "Updated at 11:56 a.m. ET on January 31AMES, IOWA—National news outlets have published a series of news articles and commentary recently devoted to the idea that Senator Bernie Sanders’s supporters are singularly cruel.This week, The New York Times dedicated 3,000 words to the subject, delineating the threats and insults sent by Sanders’s “internet army” since 2016 to its opponents online. The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin unfavorably compared his supporters to those of Donald Trump, remarking that Sanders’s is “the most divisive campaign in the primary.” A Daily Beast story warned that Sanders’s “toxic wedge of fandom … threatens to distract from his campaign and turn off potential supporters.”Yet in the face of negative coverage, Team Bernie does not seem particularly distressed, perhaps because they don’t see it as a threat to the campaign. Sanders staffers have dismissed the accusations on social media and in interviews. Written guidance from the campaign, obtained by The Atlantic, instructs volunteers to tell any voters who ask that supporters’ “Bernie bro” reputation “is a media-driven perception.”Sanders fans and volunteers I’ve spoken with are not especially concerned either—they don’t see these reports as damaging to their guy. “Each political campaign probably has their bro-y moments,” Emily Ernst, a graduate student, told me outside a Sanders rally at the Ames City Auditorium last weekend. “That’s to be expected,” said her friend, standing beside her, who declined to give his name. “There will always be some people who will be like that, but I don’t think it’s something to be concerned about.”\n",

      "Musicians are often able to wield language and sound in ways that transcend what can be communicated in writing. These unique sensibilities make the artists compelling and challenging biographical subjects.Many biographers have written about the enigmatic trumpeter Miles Davis, but it is Davis’s own autobiography (written with Quincy Troupe) that is best able to describe the inspiration for his inventive jazz. Robin D. G. Kelley’s biography of the eccentric pianist Thelonious Monk tries to disentangle the jazzman’s odd persona from his distinctive music—considering each on its own terms, and acknowledging his mental health.The singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell was bewildering to audiences, according to her biographer David Yaffe. Her sage aura and overall elusiveness amplified the poetic lyrics of her songs, earning her wide attention. Debbie Harry, the lead singer of Blondie, gained icon status by embracing the spotlight, but took care to maintain control of her own image, as she writes in her memoir, Face It.Songs themselves also have hidden lives that are worth exploring. In their recent book, the podcast hosts Nate Sloan and Charlie Harding dissect popular tunes to reveal the nuances that make them so lovable.Every Friday in the Books Briefing, we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.Know other book lovers who might like this guide?

      "“With Miles, Davis proves to be his own most perceptive critic … the book is so successful in capturing Davis’s voice (including his incessant, if tonally varied, use of profanity) that the odd line that sounds like the work of his collaborator … calls for a double take.”\n",

      "Jonah Goldberg, the conservative author and longtime fixture at National Review, used to have a go-to metaphor he’d deploy whenever he found himself defending one of his noisier compatriots in the right-wing media.“I had this whole spiel about how the conservative movement is like a symphony,” he told me in a recent interview. “You need the fine woodwinds like Yuval Levin or Irving Kristol, but you also need that guy with the big gong who just smashes out the notes.” Sure, the talk-radio ranters were shouty and crass, he would reason, but they had their part to play.These days, Goldberg has abandoned such rationalizations. “We’re holding a lot of symphonies where it’s basically all gong,” he said. “I didn’t think the gong would swamp the woodwinds quite the way it did.” Looking back, he admits even he was part of the problem: “I could be quite loud.”Now, Goldberg said, he’s ready to “atone.” Last year, he left his perch at National Review and joined a handful of prominent conservative writers to launch The Dispatch, a new media venture with a mission that’s as straightforward as it is radical: producing serious, factually grounded journalism for a conservative audience. In interviews, editors told me they aim to fill a growing void on the right’s media landscape, which they described as oversaturated with hot takes and starved of reporting, obsessed with lib-ownership and uninterested in facts. On any given day, those who get their news from the loudest voices on the right—Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Breitbart News—are bombarded with partisan propaganda, conspiracy theories, and cynical rage-bait.\n",

I was working as an editor for a division of Canwest, Canada’s largest newspaper and broadcasting company at the time, when it declared bankruptcy the following year. By 2011, I felt the way many other journalists felt at the time: exhausted by an ever-increasing workload, frustrated by the lack of risk taking in my newsroom, and confused by the bleak prospects for an industry that—a decade and a half into the internet era—still couldn’t right itself.Eager for a break—or a way out—I applied for a Nieman fellowship, a nine-month program at Harvard University, with the intention of learning MBA-speak. Journalists, I felt, needed to regain control over their own destinies, and I wanted to be a part of that solution.I got the fellowship. Sitting in a packed Harvard Business School classroom at the beginning of the fall semester, I met the professor: Clayton M. Christensen, a 6-foot-8-inch gentle giant with a beaming smile who would go on to change my life. Christensen had become a marquee name at the business school because of his research into what he described as “disruptive innovation.” Students, executives, government, and military personnel flocked to his lectures for the privilege of hearing him speak about how inexpensive new technologies slowly bled the life out of once-formidable companies.\n"

      "The statistics on impeachment are quite stark. Since 1789, 20 federal officials have been impeached by the House; only eight of them were convicted after a Senate trial. None of those, quite obviously, were presidents. And President Donald Trump is unlikely to be the first: In the face of a mountain of evidence regarding his conduct toward Ukraine and his blatant stonewalling of the House impeachment inquiry, no one with a brain thinks there is any chance he will be convicted.So it seems only fair to ask: Did the Founders make it too difficult for the Article I branch of government to remove a president?The question is an uncomfortable one. For one, it raises the possibility that the revered Founding Fathers, well, just got this wrong. And Americans do not want to think about the possibility that the Founders failed in their constitutional aspirations, and that the country’s regression to the mean of autocratic rule was thus inexorable.It also makes clear the reality that in a nation almost equally divided into two political parties with starkly different visions for the nation’s future, the supermajority threshold of 67 votes—the two-thirds requirement as specified in the Constitution—to impeach a president is an incredibly high bar. Regardless of whether senators have a principled view of a president’s particular conduct, their judgment will be overruled by the pull of party loyalty.\n",

In October, the Boise mayoral candidate Wayne Richey proposed at an election forum to build a $26 billion wall to keep out people moving from the Golden State. (His backup plan to stop the invasion of Boise? \"Trash the place.”) A viral Wall Street Journal article recounted the plight of a small Idaho town buckling under the stress of thousands of inbound Californians. And this month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a warning on Twitter to Californians moving to his state: “Remember those high taxes, burdensome regulations, & socialistic agenda advanced in CA? We don't believe in that.” The sentiment was echoed in various warnings in Dallas newspapers about the awful “California-ing” of North Texas.In 2016, President Donald Trump swept the Republican primary with a simple message: Build a wall to keep out the immigrants. Today, a new anti-migration theme is sweeping the country: Build a wall to keep out the Californians. But is the California Exodus real?From one perspective, the answer is very clearly yes. In 2012, California gained 113,000 people on net through domestic and international migration. Last year, California lost 40,000 people on net to migration, according to its own demographers. The state still grew, thanks to births, but at the lowest rate on record.

      "After two years of chaos and prevarication, the United Kingdom is finally leaving the European Union.Back in 2016, some observers predicted that Brexit would prove the frailty of the EU. The leaders of the remaining 27 European countries would be unable to find a common negotiating position. Big corporations—like the extremely powerful German carmakers—would put enormous pressure on leading politicians to cave to British demands. Brexit would be a great success and would quickly inspire other countries to follow suit.Today, it is obvious that these predictions were wide off the mark. Throughout its negotiations with London, the EU has been remarkably univocal. If the CEOs of BMW and Volkswagen exerted any pressure on Angela Merkel, she evidently ignored it. And since the British political scene has not exactly been inspiring in recent years, the risk of imminent contagion seems to have subsided. Neither Greece nor Italy is about to leave the union.Read: Why Britain BrexitedBut if Brexit demonstrated Europe’s strength, the past few years have not done anything to solve a deeper problem that has little to do with its relationship to Great Britain: The union faces a double crisis of legitimacy.\n",

      "Britain’s final days of European Union membership have mirrored much of the divisiveness and rancor that dominated the Brexit saga. Throughout that ordeal, Britons sparred over what to do, how to do it, and whether it was the right course of action at all. This time, the argument isn’t about Brexit, but about how the country’s first few moments outside the bloc, which begin tonight at 11 p.m. local time, should play out.While Brexiteers have lobbied (unsuccessfully) for Big Ben to “bong for Brexit,” those opposed to Britain’s departure have called for protests and vigils to mark the occasion. Now that the day has arrived, though, these arguments have largely subsided. For those who would have preferred that Britain remain in the EU, today is a day of national mourning that marks the official defeat of their years-long struggle. For fervent supporters of Brexit, it’s a day of celebration—the culmination of years of waiting for Britain’s “independence day.”But it’s not entirely clear if January 31 will be remembered as such a year from now, a decade from now, or even at all. Besides the British government’s decision to immortalize Britain’s departure with a commemorative 50-pence coin and a Downing Street light display, little effort has been made to formalize Brexit Day as anything resembling a national holiday. After all, how can a country create a new nationalist tradition around an event that has divided the nation?\n",

      "PARK CITY, Utah—The 2020 election loomed large over the first half of the Sundance Film Festival, as movies with galvanizing political messages dominated the lineup. Issue-focused films are nothing new, but at a festival that thrives on the spirit of niche filmmaking, the prevalence of stories and programming about ripped-from-the-headlines causes made for an energizing change of pace. Given the annual event’s reputation as a dependable bellwether for the year in independent cinema, such films could signify a potential wave of policy-driven, urgent stories to come.The Glorias, an unconventional biopic based on the life of the women’s-rights activist Gloria Steinem, plans to give away its profits to a Steinem-chosen fund dedicated to women’s issues. Directed by Julie Taymor (Frida), the film features much of Taymor’s signature maximalist flair: There are animated interludes as well as archival clips from significant moments in feminist history, plus scenes set on a bus in which the younger and older iterations of Steinem interact across time and space. To further blend her visual fantasies with reality, Taymor had planned on closing the film with footage of the real Steinem reacting to Hillary Clinton’s victory on Election Night 2016.\n",

      "After United Nations officials aired allegations that Jeff Bezos’s phone had likely been hacked in the course of his WhatsApp communications with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the logical next question was whether other rich-and-famous pen pals had been maliciously spammed too.An aide to Jared Kushner did not respond to my queries about whether Donald Trump’s son-in-law was worried about his own devices being compromised as a result of his reported WhatsApp correspondence with the Saudi leader. A spokesperson for Virgin confirmed that its billionaire founder, Richard Branson, had communicated with the crown prince (known as MbS) by phone, but told me the company had nothing more to add. Twitter, whose CEO, Jack Dorsey, has met with MbS, declined to comment.But focusing on the specific individuals who may or may not have come into the crown prince’s crosshairs risks missing the larger lesson of this episode: that these people could conceivably come into his crosshairs at all.Read: What Jeff Bezos’s reported phone hack says about billionairesIn this dystopian digital age in which we’re desperately trying to salvage some semblance of privacy, we have become accustomed to raised alarms about companies mining people’s data and about governments waging elaborate cyberattacks against their adversaries. But this is different terrain: a powerful state actor allegedly infecting a powerful non-state actor as their personal relationship soured. It’s the specter of cyberwarfare at its most atomized and human, the end of our collective innocence about adding a “new contact.”\n"

      "It is not advised, under any circumstances, to look directly at the sun. Our eyes are no match for its blaze, and the light can damage them within seconds, sometimes permanently. Remember all those news stories back in 2017, warning people to wear special, protective glasses during the solar eclipse so that they didn’t burn off their retinas? Those were good warnings.The trick is to get a very expensive telescope to do it for you.Astronomers this week released what they say is the most detailed view of the sun ever captured. There it is, squirming at the top of this article. The amber cells are the scorching plasma that covers the surface of the sun like a honeycomb. Hot gas rises from the brightest centers of the blobs, cools off, and then sinks back down into the dark crevices around them. Each molten cell is about the size of Texas.Read: It’s easier to leave the solar system than to reach the sunThe image comes from an observatory perched atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii. The Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope, named for the longtime Hawaii senator who died in 2013, just started capturing data last month.If this is what the first batch looks like, the rest seem guaranteed to bend our perception of the sun as a blinding spot in the sky. This doesn’t look like the sun at all. The zoomed-in view feels like a cosmic Rorschach test. Do you see nuggets of gold or popcorn kernels? Do you feel a sudden, confusing desire to eat it? Either way, I am mesmerized.\n",

      "Everything is just fine. Okay, there’s the Huawei thing. And the disagreement over how to deal with Iran. And global warming, trade wars, NATO, an investigation into Prince Andrew, and the requested extradition of the wife of an American diplomat who killed a British teenager. Oh, and there was that thing where the British ambassador was unceremoniously dumped after being criticized by the American president. Still, all of these are merely “wrinkles” in what remains a very smooth and special relationship between the United States and Britain.At least this was the message British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo projected in London today.Onstage, Raab and Pompeo were at pains to play down the disagreements over Huawei—Britain this week gave the Chinese telecom giant the go-ahead to build some of its 5G network, despite intense American lobbying against such a decision—and everything else. “True friends don’t always agree on everything, but you work your way through all of those issues,” Raab said. “The sea of things we do agree on overwhelms the occasional drop of disagreement, and that’s the strength of the relationship.” For Raab, these occasional drops were only about the means to a common end. Pompeo agreed.\n",

      "As the final sliver of daylight faded over the Capitol dome last night, it was clear that Democrats’ long, frustrated quest to compel a deus from the machina of impeachment would end in disappointment. Instead, there was only Representative Adam Schiff, the party’s tireless point man in the impeachment trial, who stood in the well of the Senate making an 11th-hour argument that Trump’s political-dirt-for-military-aid squeeze on Ukraine was too egregious to ignore.“If you accept the argument that the president of the United States can tell you to pound sand when you try to investigate his wrongdoing, there will be no force behind any Senate subpoena in the future,” Schiff warned the senators. It was his response to a long written statement cum question from his fellow Californian Kamala Harris, who had asked how Trump’s acquittal would “undermine the U.S. system of justice.”Since Election Night 2016, Democrats have been searching for a savior, no matter the party or rank of the individual.First there was James Comey, the self-righteous former FBI director impervious to Trump’s attempts to co-opt his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Then there was Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to take over the Russia inquiry after Trump’s abrupt dismissal of Comey produced a furor, but whose final report was an inconclusive punt. Next came House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, who said last summer that Trump deserved to be impeached because he’d “violated the law six ways from Sunday.”\n",

      "This article contains spoilers through Season 4, Episode 12 of  The Good Place.When The Good Place airs its final episode tonight, it will be the end of one of the most daring thought experiments in TV history. Over four seasons of the NBC sitcom, in which Eleanor Shellstrop (played by Kristen Bell) navigates the topsy-turvy afterlife, viewers have had their brains teased with philosophical dilemmas, metaphysical mysteries, and a Ph.D. thesis’s worth of fake gossip about real-world celebrities.But while the show’s heady themes and jokes have been much dissected, its striking visuals have been almost underrated. The creator, Mike Shur, and his team imagined hell, heaven, and the various spaces in between as a brightly lit, graphically bold remix of our own world. Again and again, they faced the task of visualizing the abstract and unthinkable: A crossroad in space-time became a pancake hole; the “void” that housed the all-knowing being Janet (D’Arcy Carden) resembled an Apple commercial.To learn about the creative process behind The Good Place’s kookily memorable look, I spoke with Adam Rowe, the show’s art director. His job is to implement the ideas of the showrunners, directors, and production designer by working with set decorators, costume managers, props masters, visual-effects producers, and others. He joined the series in Season 3, when the show’s original “Good Place” collapsed and the heroes were reincarnated on Earth. And then he worked on the fourth and final season, in which those heroes attempt to design a new and improved afterlife for humankind. This conversation has been edited.\n",
      "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/01/democrats-executive-power-warren-student-debt/605800/\n",
      "Last summer, Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled legislation to wipe out as much as $50,000 in student-loan debt for tens of millions of Americans. Pushing the $640 billion measure through even a Democratic-controlled Congress would be a punishing task, but the presidential hopeful had secured a big Capitol Hill backer in Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, a power broker in a key early-primary state and the third-ranking Democrat in the House.Earlier this month, however, Warren effectively cut Clyburn, and the rest of Congress, out of her debt-relief plan. On the eve of the most recent Democratic primary debate, she announced that on her first day as president, she would order the cancellation of the student debt herself, using a broad interpretation of existing laws. Lawmakers could sit back and watch. “We can’t afford to wait for Congress to act,” she wrote.Most Democratic presidential candidates, including Warren, have vowed to show more deference to Congress in seeking authorization for the use of military force, and they’ve condemned President Donald Trump for shirking checks on his executive authority.But as they confront the possibility that their grand progressive plans could stall out on Capitol Hill, several of the party’s past and present White House contenders have signaled that they share Trump’s expansive view of presidential authority and his impatience with—if not his outright disregard for—the legislative branch. And that has caused alarm among Democrats who don’t want their party to mimic a man who famously declared, “I alone can fix it.”\n",

      "Yesterday afternoon, Pete Buttigieg found himself on the receiving end of a good old-fashioned ratioing—that quantifiable flood of Twitter rage when a bad take elicits far more (negative) replies than likes or retweets. The backlash likely took the Buttigieg campaign by surprise, given that the tweet in question might have seemed like anodyne boilerplate at first glance.In the face of unprecedented challenges, we need a president whose vision was shaped by the American Heartland rather than the ineffective Washington politics we’ve come to know and expect.It was a populist message evidently directed at Democratic voters in Iowa heading to the caucuses on Monday, reminding them of Buttigieg’s midwestern cred as the mayor of South Bend, Indiana. But his rah-rah invocation of “the American Heartland” struck a sour note for many, including some prominent people of color.“Respectfully, where is the American Heartland located exactly in your mind as you write this tweet?” responded the filmmaker Ava DuVernay. “Does it include Compton and other places like it? Because us folks from those places would like a president shaped by our vision too.” Likewise, the Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and immigration-rights activist Jose Antonio Vargas tweeted, “Dear @PeteButtigieg: Define ‘American Heartland.’ Thanks, salamat, An undocumented gay Filipino who lives in the American Heartland of Bay Area, California.”\n"

      "Give John Bolton his due. By writing a book that apparently corroborates the core argument of those seeking to impeach and remove President Donald Trump, the former national security adviser has shown genuine moral courage. The literature on moral courage helps explain why: It’s because Bolton is an ideological fanatic. His fervent belief in supporting America’s allies and confronting its adversaries led him to speak up against Trump, who violated that principle by delaying aid to Ukraine in order to pressure it into investigating a political rival.Not everyone agrees that, in speaking up now, Bolton has acted courageously. By not coming forward earlier, my Atlantic colleague Graeme Wood has argued, Bolton “waited until speaking is to his advantage” and thus procured “a huge book deal” and the ability “to command high speaking fees before rapt right-wing audiences.”But will right-wingers really shell out large sums to hear a man who threatened the president they adore? Since the leak about his book, Bolton has been denounced by Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, who is one of his closest friends in the Senate, and Fred Fleitz, who served twice as Bolton’s chief of staff. He’s been castigated on Fox News, where he served as a contributor for 11 years. He’s put at risk his relationship with former benefactors such as the Mercer family. Surely it would have been safer to simply write a book that avoids alienating the president, as the former Trump appointees Nikki Haley and James Mattis did.\n",
      "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/there-no-christian-case-trump/605785/\n",
      "An editorial last month in the evangelical world’s flagship publication, Christianity Today, argued that Donald Trump should be removed from office.The editorial, the last one written by the editor in chief Mark Galli before his planned retirement, heartened those evangelicals who have been unsettled by their co-religionists’ enthusiastic support for Trump. But the editorial upset many others, since white evangelicals constitute arguably the strongest base of support for the president.Among those who fired back was Wayne Grudem, a distinguished research professor of theology and biblical studies at Phoenix Seminary, in Scottsdale, Arizona. Grudem is hardly a household name, but he is a significant theologian within evangelicalism. A dedicated Calvinist, he has been at the center of many recent theological debates. Grudem, who served as the general editor of the English Standard Version Study Bible, has taught ethics courses in higher education for more than 40 years. He’s the author of several major books.In a lengthy rebuttal to the Christianity Today editorial, Grudem offers an impassioned defense of Trump, something he also did in 2016, in a column titled “Why Voting for Donald Trump Is a Morally Good Choice.” Because Grudem carries considerable weight in certain evangelical quarters—to many, he’s an authoritative figure when it comes to biblical ethics—and because his position is representative of the views of many white evangelicals, it’s worth explaining why his case is ultimately unpersuasive.\n",
