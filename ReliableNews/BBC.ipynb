      "{'title': \"Dresden: The German city that declared a 'Nazi emergency'\", 'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 2, 0, 0), 'source': 'https://www.bbc.com', '_id': '/news/world-europe-50266955', 'text': 'Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA city in eastern Germany has declared a \"Nazi emergency\", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right.Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. \"\\'Nazinotstand\\' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,\" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to \"position themselves clearly\" against the far-right. \"The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I\\'m sitting with in the city council of Dresden,\" he said. The resolution acknowledges that \"right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency\" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council\\'s commitment to fostering \"a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis.\"Mr Aschenbach\\'s resolution was put to a vote by Dresden\\'s city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports.Germany\\'s governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. \"From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,\" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC.\"\\'State of emergency\\' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on \\'right-wing extremism\\' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,\" he said.Mr Donhauser added that the \"vast majority\" of Dresdeners were \"neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic\".Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that \"theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this.\"While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to \"strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence.\"Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution\\'s main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future.\"I don\\'t think that any other German city has declared a \\'Nazi emergency\\'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,\" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called \"the bombing Holocaust\", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony.The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September, support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. Pegida supporters say people need to \"wake up\" to the threat of Islamist extremists. They want Germany to curb immigration and accuse the authorities of failing to enforce existing laws.The movement has spurred large counter-rallies in the city. '}\n"

      "US President Donald Trump is set to be acquitted in his impeachment trial after senators voted against calling witnesses or admitting new evidence.\n",
      "Democrats hoped four swing Republicans would vote for witnesses, which would have extended the trial without in all likelihood changing its outcome.\n",
      "In the end, only two of the four Republicans voted with Democrats.\n",
      "The trial now moves forward to a vote on whether to acquit President Trump, which he is all but certain to win.\n",
      "Senior members of President Trump's Republican Party pushed from the outset for a speedy trial with no witnesses or new evidence. Above all, they wanted to avoid senators hearing from former National Security Adviser John Bolton.\n",
      "According to reporting by the New York Times, Mr Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that the president directly instructed him to withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for dirt on a Democratic political rival, Joe Biden.\n",
      "Testimony from Mr Bolton about his involvement in the Ukraine affair threatened to significantly undermine the case made by the president's lawyers during his trial.\n",
      "Trump was impeached on two charges - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The first charge stemmed from an allegation that he pressured Ukraine to damage Mr Biden for his own political benefit. The second from an allegation that he purposefully obstructed the Congressional impeachment investigation.\n",
      "The Senate will vote on Wednesday 5 February on whether to convict or acquit the president on the two articles of impeachment brought against him. \n",
      "Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said there would be four votes on Friday night on Democratic amendments, followed by closing arguments on Monday, speeches from senators from Monday to Wednesday, and a final vote on Wednesday - the day after President Trump's State of the Union address. \n",
      "A two-thirds majority in the chamber of 67 votes is required to remove him from office. The Republicans control the Senate with a 53-47 majority over Democrats, and no Republican senator has signalled that they plan to vote for Mr Trump's removal. \n",
      "Eyes will instead fall on several Democrats in Republican-leaning states who have indicated they may vote to acquit. Any Democratic defections would be a symbolic victory for the president that he will likely use to his advantage on the campaign trail in the coming months.\n",
      "The battle over witnesses intensified a week ago after reports emerged that Mr Bolton might have highly damaging testimony about the president's involvement an alleged quid pro quo with Ukraine.\n",
      "Mr Bolton's forthcoming book reportedly alleges that the president personally directed the scheme to get dirt from Ukraine on Mr Biden, a former US vice president. The revelations threatened to undo Republican arguments that no impeachment witness had first-hand testimony of the president's involvement.\n",
      "But the slim chance of Mr Bolton being called to give testimony to the Senate slipped away from Democrats on Friday, after two of the four Republican senators they had hoped would defect confirmed that they would not.\n",
      "Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said in a statement late on Thursday that, while the Democrats had clearly demonstrated the president's actions were \"inappropriate\", they had not proved to be impeachable offenses.\n",
      "\"The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did,\" he said. \n",
      "\"I believe that the constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.\"\n",
      "Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, another moderate, said in a statement on Friday afternoon: \"The House chose to send articles of impeachment that are rushed and flawed. I carefully considered the need for additional witnesses and documents, to cure the shortcomings of its process, but ultimately decided that I will vote against considering motions to subpoena.\"\n",
      "Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah decided to vote to call witnesses, but they were alone among the 53-strong Republican Senate caucus. \n",
      "Democratic House impeachment managers said throughout the process that a trial without witnesses amounted to a sham trial. They were joined on Friday by President Trump's former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, who told a New Jersey publication that Mr Trump had been subjected to only \"half a trial\".\n",
      "Donald Trump's Senate impeachment trial is all but over.\n",
      "Barring an unforeseen and unexpected blockbuster development, a largely party-line vote will acquit him of the two charges brought by the House of Representatives, which itself approved those articles of impeachment on a nearly party-line vote.\n",
      "Both sides will soon be left to sift through the political rubble just nine months before a national election that has the entire House, more than a third of the Senate and the presidency itself on the ballot.\n",
      "According to polls, the nation's political disposition is much as it was before the impeachment process began. The US is sharply divided along partisan lines. The president's approval ratings hover in the low to mid-40s, roughly where they've been the entirety of his term in office. His re-election chances are dicey but far from slim.\n",
      "The decision not to seek witnesses - which polls show Americans overwhelming wanted - may be forgotten before long.\n",
      "Polls don't tell the whole story, however, and there are other signs that the impeachment proceedings have made an impact.\n",
      "Three of the four Democratic senators running for president tweeted in the moments after the witnesses vote went against the party.\n",
      "\"Senate Republicans just failed the American people & broke their oath to the United States Constitution,\" wrote Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren.\n",
      "Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, wrote: \"I've never heard of a trial where you don't have witnesses. This is a sad day in American history.\"\n",
      "Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota wrote: \"If you don't have witnesses, you do not have a fair trial. The truth will come out.\"\n",
      "Marco Rubio, Republican senator for Florida, said: \"Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office.\"\n",
      "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50813696\n",
      "For only the third time in history, an American president is on trial after being impeached.\n",
      "Such a trial could, in theory, lead to President Donald Trump being removed from office. That outcome would be a huge shock - we'll explain why later - but the very fact a president is facing trial is significant.\n",
      "Here are eight questions and answers that will help you understand the trial.\n",
      "Put simply, it's a process that allows senior figures in government to hold other officials (like judges, the president and cabinet members) to account if they're suspected of committing offences while in office.\n",
      "Those offences can include \"treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours\".\n",
      "After someone is impeached, they then go on trial in the Senate, the upper house of Congress, and its members decide whether they guilty or not. It's a political trial, not a criminal one.\n",
      "He's facing two articles of impeachment, or charges.\n",
      "Firstly, he's accused of seeking help from Ukraine's government to help himself get re-elected this November. He's alleged to have held back millions of dollars of military aid to Ukraine and dangled a proposed White House meeting with Ukraine's president, both as bargaining chips.\n",
      "In exchange, witnesses say he wanted Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into Joe Biden, the man who's leading the Democratic race to challenge him in the election. Polls suggest Mr Biden would beat him if chosen as the Democratic candidate.\n",
      "Secondly, after the White House refused to allow staff to testify at the first impeachment hearings last year, Democrats accused Mr Trump of obstructing Congress (the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws, and which was investigating him).\n",
      "Mr Trump has denied any wrongdoing and his legal team say the \"flimsy\" charges are a \"dangerous perversion of the Constitution\".\n",
      "It's worth emphasising that this has nothing to do with the special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia. That ended with no further action against Mr Trump himself.\n",
      "This is what led us to this moment:\n",
      "The US Constitution is a bit vague when it comes to the specifics of managing impeachment. But there are general rules, based largely on the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868. In that case, the president just about kept his job.\n",
      "The only other president to face an impeachment trial was Bill Clinton in 1999. He too survived.\n",
      "On the first day of the trial, senators had to vote on the rules drawn up by Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate. This led to 12 hours of rancorous debate that stretched deep into the night.\n",
      "Republicans - who make up the majority in the Senate by 53 members to 47 - rejected attempts by Democrats to introduce new witnesses and documents at the start of the trial. Democrats were left furious by the decision.\n",
      "Mr McConnell also decided not to proceed with an original plan to cram both sides' opening arguments into four 12-hour days.\n",
      "Some of the other rules include: no live tweeting from the chamber, and no outside reading materials to be brought in. Senators are also not allowed to speak to those sitting near them while the case is being heard.\n",
      "Senators will hear from both sides - prosecutors from the House of Representatives and lawyers from the White House - as well as from any witnesses. After that, senators will be given a full day to deliberate before they vote on whether to convict Mr Trump.\n",
      "A two-thirds majority of 67 votes in the 100-seat Senate is required to convict and oust Mr Trump. But because Republicans have a majority of 53 to 47 in the Senate, the president is widely expected to be cleared.\n",
      "In the unlikely event of Mr Trump being found guilty, he would be removed from office and Vice-President Mike Pence would be sworn in as president.\n",
      "A simple majority of senators - 51 - could also vote to end the trial should they wish.\n",
      "Each senator, including Mr McConnell, has delivered an oath promising to deliver \"impartial justice\" during the trial. But Mr McConnell last month said: \"I'm not an impartial juror\", and has also said he and his party are working hand-in-hand with the White House.\n",
      "\"Everything I do during this, I'm co-ordinating with the White House counsel,\" he told Fox News, to the fury of senior Democrats.\n",
      "He is not presiding over the trial - that job has gone to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, although the 100 senators will ultimately act as both judge and jury. Justice Roberts is there to make sure the trial sticks to the predetermined rules.\n",
      "A group of seven Democrats are acting as impeachment managers - essentially prosecutors for the House, who will present its case for impeachment to the Senate. They include Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, both frequent targets of Mr Trump's anger.\n",
      "President Trump's defence team includes special prosecutors from President Bill Clinton's impeachment - Ken Starr and Robert Ray. \n",
      "Alan Dershowitz, whose past clients include OJ Simpson, is also part of the team led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Mr Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "This was one of the central questions in the trial. Republicans were keen for a speedy trial with no witnesses or new documents. Democrats wanted to bring in both - they said there was fresh evidence that wasn't heard in the House.\n",
      "Democrats hoped four moderate swing Republicans would vote with them to call for witnesses, allowing them to hear from the former National Security Adviser John Bolton - who reports suggested had damaging first hand testimony about the president's involvement in the Ukraine scandal.\n",
      "In the end, only two of the four swing Republicans voted for witnesses, damning the Democrats' hope to hear from Mr Bolton and others. \n",
      "President Clinton's trial had no live witnesses, but much more evidence and testimony had been gathered by the House before the trial.\n",
      "Next week, almost certainly.\n",

      "The impeachment trial of President Donald Trump is hurdling towards its conclusion as senators prepare to cast votes after arguments on both sides ended on Thursday.\n",
      "It comes after Democrats suffered an apparent blow to their hopes of introducing new witnesses to the trial that could help their case for removing Mr Trump from office.\n",
      "Democratic congressmen who serve as prosecutors in the trial had laid out meticulous evidence over three days that they said proved Mr Trump had abused his power and obstructed Congress. \n",
      "They alleged that he pressured Ukraine to dig up political dirt on Joe Biden, a domestic rival, and that he sought to hide the evidence from Congress, another impeachable offence. \n",
      "President Trump and senior Republicans claim Mr Biden and his son Hunter were involved in a corrupt business scheme in Ukraine. \n",
      "The White House lawyers, on the other hand, argued Mr Trump had done \"nothing wrong\" and that the president has not committed offences that would warrant his removal. \n",
      "Here's a look back at what happened over the course of just under two weeks.\n",
      "Proceedings began on 21 January with a tussle between Democrats and Republicans over the rules of the trial. \n",
      "Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell proposed a tight two-day limit for opening arguments by both sides, before extending it to three after protests from Democrats.\n",
      "Mr McConnell delayed debate over motions from Democrats to allow new witnesses to be called and fresh evidence submitted.\n",
      "Democratic congressman Adam Schiff, the head of seven impeachment managers who serve as prosecutors, opened oral arguments to a packed Senate chamber on 22 January.\n",
      "Mr Schiff said the president's actions were exactly what the Founding Fathers feared when they came up with impeachment - \"a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat\", Mr Schiff said.\n",
      "The impeachment managers walked the senators through testimony gathered during depositions and committee hearings last year that they say points to a scheme by Mr Trump and his advisers to lean on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. \n",
      "The managers interspersed their oral arguments with audio and video tape, using the president's own words - including a now-infamous call with the president of Ukraine - in their effort to portray him as guilty.\n",
      "They directly addressed the claims against the Bidens - a purposeful attempt to get on the front foot ahead of the president's defence.\n",
      "The managers then tackled the obstruction of Congress charge. \n",
      "The managers argued that Mr Trump's refusal to allow certain members of his administration to answer questions from the House of Representatives was akin to hiding information from a grand jury investigation. \n",
      "During opening arguments, Mr Trump's team took barely two hours to argue that the president had done nothing wrong.\n",
      "His team insisted that Mr Trump had acted in the national interests in his phone call with the Ukrainian president, with Deputy White House Counsel Mike Purpura pinpointing a line from the transcript in which Mr Trump asked Volodymyr Zelensky to \"do us a favour\", rather than \"me\". \n",
      "Mr Purpura also insisted there was no quid pro quo, saying Mr Zelensky \"says he felt no pressure\". \n",
      "The defence accused the Democrats of trying to remove Mr Trump from the ballot this year, and said the American electorate should be allowed to decide for themselves.  \n",
      "Resuming arguments on 27 January, attorney Kenneth Starr warned senators that impeachment could become \"normalised\" and used as a weapon against future administrations. \n",
      "Mr Starr came to prominence in 1998, when he led an investigation into Democratic President Bill Clinton that laid the foundation for his impeachment.\n",
      "\"Like war, impeachment is hell,\" Mr Starr said on Monday. \"It's filled with acrimony and divides the country like nothing else. Those of us who lived through the Clinton impeachment understand that in a deep and personal way.\" \n",
      "Following Mr Starr, Trump defence lawyer Jane Raskin addressed Rudy Giuliani - Mr Trump's personal attorney and a central character in the impeachment case.\n",
      "\"Mr Giuliani was not on a political errand,\" she said, referring to his investigations in Ukraine. \n",
      "\"Rudy Giuliani is the House managers' colourful distraction,\" Ms Raskin said - a way for the Democratic impeachment managers, who act as prosecutors, to divert attention from weaknesses in their case. \n",
      "On 29 January, senators began a period of questioning after opening arguments concluded.\n",
      "Over two days and 16 hours on the floor, they submitted over 100 queries written on cards to Chief Justice John Roberts, who read them to the House managers and defence. \n",
      "The justice was firm about keeping time, limiting answers to five minutes.\n",
      "Questions alternated between Republicans and Democrats as lawmakers had their first chance to push back against claims made by both sides. A few queries were bipartisan.\n",
      "Senators were not, however, allowed to address each other in their questioning.\n",
      "The queries came amid a contentious debate over whether or not witnesses should be allowed in the trial - a matter that comes to a vote on Friday. \n",
      "One submission was blocked by the Chief Justice: Republican Rand Paul's question that included the name of a person believed to be the whistleblower that sparked the entire impeachment inquiry was rejected.\n",
      "Other questions, including when the president ordered the aid hold on Ukraine and whether Mr Trump ever mentioned the Bidens prior to Joe Biden entering the 2020 race, were not fully answered.\n",
      "On Friday, the trial moves into four hours of debate over whether new witnesses and documents should be permitted.\n",
      "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51275092\n",
      "The legal team representing President Donald Trump at his impeachment trial has wrapped up its opening arguments.\n",
      "They followed three days of arguments from the Democratic congressmen serving as prosecutors, who accuse the president of abusing his power and obstructing Congress.\n",
      "Our readers asked some questions and I've answered a selection here.\n",
      "In 1974, the Judiciary Committee of the US House approved three articles of impeachment against then-President Richard Nixon, accusing him of obstruction of justice, abuse of presidential power and contempt of Congress. \n",
      "These arose from the president's attempts to cover-up his administration's involvement in a botched break-in to the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate office complex, although the abuse of power charge also included improperly accessing confidential tax records and ordering wiretaps and tax audits of political opponents.\n",
      "Nixon resigned before the full House could vote to impeach him.\n",
      "While not exactly tracking the language of the Nixon accusations, Donald Trump's impeachment articles are similar, alleging abuse of presidential power and obstruction of Congress. In Trump's case, the misconduct, according to Democrats, involved his attempts to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically and block Congress's investigation into the matter.\n",
      "Republicans have tried to draw a distinction between the two impeachment investigations, arguing that Nixon's arose from an underlying crime - the break-in - while Trump's was an exercise of legal presidential power. Democrats, and their legal experts, have said a technical violation of a criminal statute is not required for impeachment and removal.\n",
      "This is a frequent Republican objection to the president's impeachment - that the Democrats rushed the process to finish before the end of 2019, instead of working harder to obtain documents and witness testimony being blocked by the White House.\n",
      "Democrats say that if they had gone to court to fight out the administration's blanket order for all current and former officials not to co-operate with the House impeachment probe, the process could have dragged on for months, if not years. They cite the example of Don McGahn, the president's former White House counsel, whose testimony congressional Democrats sought regarding the administration's handling of the Robert Mueller Russia investigation.  \n",
      "The House subpoenaed McGahn last May and filed suit against the White House for refusing to allow his testimony in August. Three months later, a lower court ordered McGahn to comply with the subpoena, but that decision has been on hold pending an appeal to an intermediate circuit court. Even if the Democrats win again, the administration will almost certainly appeal to the Supreme Court, adding further delays.\n",
      "Democrats say a similar situation would play itself out if they tried to subpoena former National Security Advisor John Bolton, for instance, or acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney - both of whom could have information relevant to Trump's Ukraine actions.\n",
      "Democrats aren't the only ones hankering for witnesses. Republicans are warning that if their counterparts open up that Pandora's box, they'll insist on testimony from Hunter Biden, as well. \n",
      "They view his work for the Ukrainian energy company Burisma to be irrelevant and simply an attempt by Republicans to raise unfounded doubts and suspicions about his father, presidential candidate Joe Biden.\n",
      "\"What can Hunter Biden tell us about the president's obstruction of Congress?\" Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday. \"Nothing, obviously.\"\n",
      "Republicans counter that Democrats have said Trump had no valid reason to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens - an argument they say is undermined if they can establish Hunter was engaged in corrupt activities.\n",
      "According to the US Constitution, the chief justice's role is to \"preside\" over the impeachment trial. What that means in practice is determined by Senate rules and the precedent set by the two previous presidential impeachment trials.\n",
      "When William Rehnquist presided over Bill Clinton's trial in 1999, his role was very limited - mostly issuing the oath to senators, gavelling proceedings to order and recess, and reading questions from the senators to the impeachment managers and the presidential defence team. \n",
      "So far, Chief Justice John Roberts has followed the model set by the man he once clerked for. His only notable departure was when he admonished both sides in the trial to temper their rhetoric and refrain from language that is \"not conducive to civil discourse\" after a series of heated exchanges between the two legal teams early last Wednesday morning.\n",
      "As the presiding officer, the chief justice is authorised to issue rulings on procedures and evidence during the trial, although his decisions are subject to reversal by the vote of a majority of the Senate. \n",
      "In an opinion article published in the New York Times on Sunday, however, three legal experts suggested that Roberts' powers may be greater than many realise - and could impact upon the witness debate mentioned above. Citing Senate rules dating back to President Andrew Johnson's 1868 impeachment trial, they argue that the chief justice has the authority to issue subpoenas for testimony and documents at the request of one of the legal teams - and can only be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the Senate.\n",
      "At some point, all the debate over witnesses and evidence will come to an end an it will be time to vote. When they do, the impeachment articles will be like silver bullets for werewolves -just one can kill a presidency. \n",
      "The Senate votes on each article separately, and if any get 67 out of 100 votes in favour, the president is removed from office and a separate vote is held on whether to disqualify the now ex-president from all future elective office. \n",
      "That raises the tantalising possibility of an impeached and removed president being allowed to subsequently run for, and win back, the presidency.\n",
      "Sounds like the makings of a good political intrigue novel.\n",
      "If the trial vote goes like past presidential impeachments, there will be a roll call of all 100 senators, who will then render their judgement - \"guilty\" or \"not guilty\". It doesn't have to be that way, however.\n",
      "Former Senator Jeff Flake suggested last autumn that if it were a secret ballot, enough Republican senators would vote against the president to remove him from office. The only thing keeping them in line, he said, was fear of recrimination from the president if they failed or his supporters if they succeeded. \n",
      "Conceivably, the Senate could vote to make the removal process a secret ballot - although there's a provision in the Constitution, the journal clause, that allows 20 or more senators to demand a recorded vote.\n",
      "The political obstacles to a secret ballot seem like the greatest ones, however. Impeachment and removal was designed by the Constitution's founders to be a public act - which is why they put it in the hands of politicians to begin with. The public may not take too kindly to politicians voting to move that process behind closed doors. \n",
      "Just because the Trump will probably be acquitted doesn't mean he's out of the woods for good. The general legal consensus is that while it's debatable whether a president can be prosecuted while in office, former presidents can be charged with criminal offences they committed while in office, assuming the statute of limitations has not expired.\n",
      "Back during the Mueller Russia investigation, there was all sorts of speculation that the special counsel's office was preparing \"sealed\" indictments that would be waiting for the president once he no longer had the theoretical immunities of his office.\n",
      "That talk has died down now, but back during the Watergate scandal the prospect of a post-presidential indictment was real enough to prompt Nixon's successor, Gerald Ford, to issue a blanket pardon for Nixon's actions as president in the name of national \"healing\".\n",
      "Given that polls show the public's faith in US institutions and government has steadily declined since then, I'd say it's a mission not accomplished. \n",

      "The US has declared a public health emergency over the spread of the coronavirus and said it would deny entry to any foreign nationals who have visited China in the past two weeks.\n",
      "US citizens returning from Hubei province, where the outbreak started, will be quarantined for 14 days.\n",
      "Nearly 10,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed, most of them in China, since it emerged in December.\n",
      "More than 100 cases have been reported outside China, in 22 countries.\n",
      "On Friday, Beijing said the death toll had risen by 45 to 258 - all of them in China and 249 in Hubei.\n",
      "Earlier, it emerged that the number of new coronavirus cases worldwide had overtaken that of the Sars epidemic, which spread to more than two dozen countries in 2003.\n",
      "There were around 8,100 cases of Sars - severe acute respiratory syndrome - during the eight-month outbreak. In total, 774 people were killed by Sars.\n",
      "On Thursday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a global health emergency over the new outbreak.\n",
      "In a public statement on Friday, US Health Secretary Alex Azar said US citizens returning from Hubei province would face 14 days of quarantine while those returning from other parts of China would be allowed to monitor their own condition for a similar period.\n",
      "\"Following the World Health Organization decision, I have today declared that the coronavirus represents a public health emergency in the United States,\" he told reporters.\n",
      "Citing the need to relieve pressure on authorities, he said that foreign nationals who had travelled in China in the past 14 days would be denied entry to the US.\n",
      "\"The risk of infection for Americans remains low and with these, and our previous, actions we are working to keep the risk low,\" he added.\n",
      "Another confirmed case in the US on Friday - in California - brought the number there to seven. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said 191 people were under observation for the disease.\n",
      "The US announcement came as other countries around the world scrambled to contain the spread of the new virus, 2019-nCov.\n",
      "On Friday, the UK confirmed its first two cases.\n",
      "Estimates by the University of Hong Kong suggest the true total number of cases could be far higher than official figures suggest. Based on mathematical models of the outbreak, experts there say more than 75,000 people may have been infected in the city of Wuhan alone, where the virus first emerged. \n",
      "Most cases outside China involve people who have been to Wuhan. But Germany, Japan, Vietnam, the US, Thailand and South Korea have reported person-to-person cases - patients being infected by people who had travelled to China.\n",
      "WHO spokesman Chris Lindmeier warned that closing borders could in fact accelerate its spread, with travellers entering countries unofficially.\n",
      "\"As we know from other scenarios, be it Ebola or other cases, whenever people want to travel, they will. And if the official paths are not opened, they will find unofficial paths,\" he said.\n",
      "He said the best way to track the virus was at official border crossings.\n",
      "Meanwhile in Wuhan, voluntary evacuations of hundreds of foreign nationals are under way.\n",
      "The UK, Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand are expected to quarantine all evacuees for two weeks to monitor them for symptoms and avoid contagion.\n",
      "Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas Island, 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland in a detention centre that has been used to house asylum seekers.\n",
      "In other developments:\n",
      "A confirmed case in Tibet means the virus has now reached every region in mainland China.\n",
      "The central province of Hubei, with a population of nearly 60 million people and where nearly all deaths have occurred, is in a state of lockdown.\n",
      "Wuhan has effectively been sealed off and China has put numerous transport restrictions in place to curb the spread of the virus. People who have been in Hubei are also being told to work from home. \n",
      "China has said it will send charter planes to bring back Hubei residents who are overseas \"as soon as possible\". A foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the \"practical difficulties\" Chinese citizens had faced abroad.\n",
      "The virus is affecting China's economy, the world's second-largest, with a growing number of countries advising their citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to the country.\n",

      "The US has announced it is expanding its curbs on immigration to include six more countries, including Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation.\n",
      "Citizens from Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar will now be blocked from obtaining certain types of visas. \n",
      "People from those countries will still be able to visit the US as tourists.\n",
      "In 2018 the US issued twice as many immigration visas to Nigeria than to the other five nations combined.\n",
      "An official said the new measures were the result of failures by the six countries to meet US security and information-sharing standards.\n",
      "\"These countries, for the most part, want to be helpful but for a variety of different reasons simply failed to meet those minimum requirements that we laid out,\" acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf told reporters on Friday.\n",
      "He said officials would work with the countries on bolstering their security requirements to help them get off the list.\n",
      "US President Donald Trump first introduced a travel ban in 2017. It currently closes US borders to citizens from seven countries, most of them with Muslim majorities.\n",
      "In 2018 the US issued more than 8,000 immigration visas to citizens of Nigeria. That same year, just over 2,000 were issued to Sudanese nationals, 290 to Tanzanians, and just 31 to Eritreans. \n",
      "The US had previously announced a ban on certain types of visas for Eritreans in 2017.\n",
      "The US said it would suspend the issuance of visas that can lead to permanent residency for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, and Myanmar.\n",
      "Sudanese and Tanzanian nationals will no longer be allowed to apply for \"diversity visas\", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US. \n",
      "Mr Wolf said non-immigrant visas given to people for temporary stays - including visitors, those doing business or people seeking medical treatment - would not be impacted by the new rules. \n",
      "Of the new nationalities facing visa restrictions, Nigerians account for the most immigration to the US. \n",
      "According to US government statistics, the State Department issued 8,018 immigrant visas to Nigerians in the fiscal year 2018.\n",
      "Kyrgyzstan and Sudan have large Muslim majorities, while around 50% of people in Nigeria and Eritrea are Muslim. Tanzania also has a sizable Muslim community.\n",
      "Mr Trump signed a controversial travel ban just seven days after taking office in January 2017, arguing it was vital to protect Americans. \n",
      "The ban initially excluded people from seven majority-Muslim countries but the list was modified following a series of court challenges.\n",
      "It now restricts citizens of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea.\n",

      "A one-time aspiring actress says Harvey Weinstein subjected her to \"degrading\" abuse, in some of the most graphic testimony shared in his trial so far.\n",
      "Jessica Mann detailed a catalogue of abuse by the Hollywood producer, saying he once trapped her in a hotel bedroom and raped her.\n",
      "Three of the five charges against Mr Weinstein relate to Ms Mann. \n",
      "He denies non-consensual sex and his lawyers say emails prove his and Ms Mann's relationship was consensual.\n",
      "WARNING: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting\n",
      "Ms Mann's evidence came at the end of the fourth week of the Manhattan trial of the Oscar-winning Hollywood mogul, who produced films including Shakespeare in Love and The English Patient.\n",
      "The 34-year-old said she met him in late 2012 or early 2013 at a party, and she told him of her ambition to be an actress. Later, she said, he invited her and a friend to a Los Angeles hotel suite. He then allegedly pulled Ms Mann into a bedroom and performed oral sex on her.\n",
      "Ms Mann then began a relationship with Mr Weinstein. \"I entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him and it was extremely degrading from that point on,\" she said.\n",
      "She said he once urinated on her, and in 2013 raped her in a Manhattan hotel room. \"If he heard the word 'no,' it was like a trigger for him,\" she said.\n",
      "When asked why she stayed in the relationship, Ms Mann said in tears that there was \"no short answer\".\n",
      "\"One of the aspects initially was that I had had a sexual encounter\" with him, she said. \"That wasn't something I could undo. That really confused me and hurt me.\" She stayed with him partly out of fear, she said.\n",
      "One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, said Ms Mann sent \"flattering\" emails to Mr Weinstein during their relationship, one of which said \"Miss you, big guy.\" These prove the relationship was not abusive, the defence alleges.\n",
      "In Friday's testimony, Ms Mann also alleged that Mr Weinstein had \"extreme scarring\" on his body and used erectile dysfunction medication. She also believed he was intersex, and it appeared he had a vagina and no testicles. \n",
      "Since October 2017, more than 80 women have publicly accused Mr Weinstein of sexual misconduct but this criminal case involves only a few of them. \n",
      "Some consider the trial a watershed moment, where some of Mr Weinstein's alleged victims have had their voices heard in court for the first time.  \n",
      "Mr Weinstein is on trial for five offences, including rape and predatory sexual assault. He denies the charges and all allegations of wrongdoing, but if convicted could face life in prison.\n",
      "Here is what has happened in the trial so far.\n",
      "Mr Weinstein turned up to his first court appearance heavily aided and using a walking frame. Crowds of protesters, including some accusers, gathered outside the courthouse to try and face him down. \n",
      "\"You thought you could terrorise me and others into silence. You were wrong,\" actress Rose McGowan, who accuses him of rape, said reading from an open letter.\n",
      "The same day, on 6 January, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office announced new charges against Mr Weinstein. After the New York trial, he is expected to appear in court in California.\n",
      "Finding an impartial jury for the New York case was a difficult task, with hundreds summoned as potential jurors. Mr Weinstein's legal team even filed a last-minute motion to move the trial outside Manhattan over the \"carnival-like atmosphere\" surrounding proceedings. They cited the media hype about model Gigi Hadid being among the potential jurors. \n",
      "The first week of proceedings ended with a flash-mob of protesters performing an anti-rape chant outside, which could be heard inside the courtroom. \n",
      "During the process, prosecutors accused Mr Weinstein's defence team of \"systematically eliminating\" young white women as jurors. The selection process concluded with five women and seven men on the panel. \n",
      "\"This trial is not a referendum on the #MeToo movement. It is not a referendum on sexual harassment,\" Judge James Burke told the jury, saying they must only decide if Mr Weinstein \"committed certain acts which constitute a particular crime\".\n",
      "\"The man seated right there was not just a titan in Hollywood, he was a rapist,\" prosecutor Meghan Hast said in her opening statement on 22 January.\n",
      "She accused him of using his celebrity status to manipulate women and explicitly detailed allegations against him. Only two of the accusers' cases, Mimi (Miriam) Haleyi and Jessica Mann, have led to individual criminals charges in New York but the testimony of others is being used as supporting evidence.\n",
      "Ms Hast described how Mr Weinstein allegedly \"lunged at\" Ms Haleyi in 2006 to perform a forced sex act on her. Ms Mann alleges he raped her in a New York hotel in 2013.\n",
      "One of Mr Weinstein's lawyers, Damon Cheronis, insists the state's case would \"unravel\" during the trial and urged the jury: \"While the narrative they painted for you is one that may reinforce your preconceived notions, it's not the truth.\"\n",
      "The defence aim to present the sexual interactions as consensual. At the opening, Mr Cheronis alleged one accuser had even described Mr Weinstein as \"her casual boyfriend\". \n",
      "US actress Annabella Sciorra testified on 23 January that the film producer raped her in the winter of 1993/4. Her allegations, outside New York's statue of limitations, are being used to support the most serious charge of predatory sexual assault. \n",
      "She said Mr Weinstein forced her way into her apartment after a dinner with others. \"I was trying to get him off me,\" she told the jury. \"I was punching him, kicking him.\" \n",
      "The former Sopranos actress described her body shaking after the alleged assault and said she did not go public with it for years because she was \"afraid for her life\". Ms Sciorra's friend, fellow actress Rosie Perez, testified that she shared some details of the incident with her at the time, but on cross-examination lawyers challenged Ms Sciorra's ability to remember the exact date of the alleged attack. \n",
      "A forensic psychiatrist, Dr Barbara Ziv, also testified as an expert witness to explain misconceptions around rape and the behaviour of victims.\n",
      "Production assistant Mimi Haleyi told the court that Mr Weinstein assaulted her twice in Manhattan in 2006, after he helped her get a job on a television show he produced. \n",
      "She detailed an incident at his apartment where she alleges he performed oral sex on her, without consent, when she was on her period. \n",
      "\"Every time I tried to get off the bed he would push me back and hold me down,\" Ms Haleyi said during emotional testimony. \"At this point I realised what was happening. I'm being raped.\"\n",
      "She told the court he convinced her to meet again weeks later. On that occasion she allegedly \"laid there\" as he had sex with her in an incident that left her feeling \"numb\" and like \"an idiot\". Mr Weinstein has only been charged over first alleged encounter. \n",
      "During cross-examination Mr Weinstein's defence focused on her continued contact with him after the alleged incidents and presented email exchanges between the two including one she signed off with \"lots of love\".\n",
      "Throughout the week further \"prior bad acts\" witnesses continued to testify. Former actress Dawn Dunning alleged Mr Weinstein put her hands up her skirt and touched her genitals at a hotel in Soho in 2004 and later tried to offer her film roles in exchange for sex. \n",
      "Tarale Wulff alleged Mr Weinstein masturbated in front of her in 2005 when she worked as a waitress. She said she was later invited to read scripts by Weinstein Company staff and was taken to his apartment, where he allegedly raped her.\n",

      "Island Express Helicopters was restricted to flying under what are known as visual flight rules, meaning pilots must be able to see clearly outside the aircraft in daylight, Keith Holloway, a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) spokesman, told the Reuters news agency.  \n",
      "The company was not permitted to fly using cockpit instruments alone.  \n",
      "Mr Holloway said it was not known if the pilot, Ara Zobayan, was flying on instruments at the time of the wreck\n",
      "Mr Zobayan was licensed to fly by cockpit instruments, Kurt Deetz, a former pilot for the company who flew Bryant for two years, told Forbes. \n",
      "However, he added: \"I don't think he had any actual [experience] inside the clouds.\"\n",
      "Island Express referred a request for comment to the NTSB.\n",
      "On Thursday the firm said it was suspending operations.\n",
      "\"The shock of the accident affected all staff, and management decided that service would be suspended until such time as it was deemed appropriate for staff and customers,\" it said in a statement.\n",
      "The aircraft - a Sikorsky S-76B - went down into a hillside outside the city of Calabasas on Sunday morning.\n",
      "Conditions were foggy when the flight took off, and local police had grounded their helicopters due to the poor weather.\n",
      "The pilot asked air traffic controllers for a special clearance, known as Special Visual Flight Rules, to fly in less than optimal weather, said NTSB board member Jennifer Homendy, who went to the crash scene to collect evidence.\n",
      "The helicopter, she added, circled in the air for 12 minutes before being given the clearance. The pilot then asked controllers for \"flight following\", an assistance given to helicopters to avoid collisions, but was told the craft was too low to be picked up by radar.\n",
      "Minutes later, the pilot said he was \"climbing to avoid a cloud layer\", she added. The helicopter climbed and began a left descending turn, according to radar data, before communication was lost \"consistent with the accident location\".\n",
