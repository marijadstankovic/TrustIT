      "{'title': \"Dresden: The German city that declared a 'Nazi emergency'\", 'date': datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 2, 0, 0), 'source': 'https://www.bbc.com', '_id': '/news/world-europe-50266955', 'text': 'Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkThese are external links and will open in a new windowA city in eastern Germany has declared a \"Nazi emergency\", saying it has a serious problem with the far-right.Dresden, the capital of Saxony, has long been viewed as a bastion of the far-right and is the birthplace of the anti-Islam Pegida movement. Councillors in the city - a contender for the 2025 European Capital of Culture - have now approved a resolution saying more needs to be done to tackle the issue. But opponents say it goes too far. \"\\'Nazinotstand\\' means - similar to the climate emergency - that we have a serious problem. The open democratic society is threatened,\" local councillor Max Aschenbach, who tabled the motion, told the BBC. Mr Aschenbach, from left-leaning satirical political party Die Partei, said he believed it was necessary to take action because politicians were not doing enough to \"position themselves clearly\" against the far-right. \"The request was an attempt to change that. I also wanted to know what kind of people I\\'m sitting with in the city council of Dresden,\" he said. The resolution acknowledges that \"right-wing extremist attitudes and actions... are occurring with increasing frequency\" and calls on the city to help victims of far-right violence, protect minorities and strengthen democracy. Mr Aschenbach said adopting the motion showed the city council\\'s commitment to fostering \"a free, liberal, democratic society that protects minorities and resolutely opposes Nazis.\"Mr Aschenbach\\'s resolution was put to a vote by Dresden\\'s city council on Wednesday night and approved by 39 votes to 29, according to local media reports.Germany\\'s governing Christian Democrats (CDU) were among those to reject the resolution. \"From our point of view, this was primarily an intended provocation,\" Jan Donhauser, chairman of the CDU City Council Group, told the BBC.\"\\'State of emergency\\' means the collapse or a serious threat to public order. That is not given rudimentarily. Furthermore, the focus on \\'right-wing extremism\\' does not do justice to what we need. We are the guardians of the liberal-democratic basic order and no violence, no matter from which extremist side it comes, is compatible with it,\" he said.Mr Donhauser added that the \"vast majority\" of Dresdeners were \"neither right-wing extremists nor anti-democratic\".Mr Aschenbach said the city was not obliged to take any action following the adoption of his resolution, but that \"theoretically, existing measures should be given a higher priority and future decisions should follow this.\"While opposing the resolution, the CDU said it hopes to \"strengthen the institutions that are best suited to combating politically motivated violence.\"Kai Arzheimer, a German politics professor who has written extensively on far-right extremism, said the resolution\\'s main impact was symbolic, but that it could mean that more money would be allocated to programmes combating extremism in the future.\"I don\\'t think that any other German city has declared a \\'Nazi emergency\\'. Resolutions against right-wing extremism are not so uncommon, however,\" he said. Dresden has long been known for its links to the far right. In the early 1990s, neo-Nazi groups began staging rallies there to remember what they called \"the bombing Holocaust\", when the city was bombed by British and American forces in 1945, Mr Arzheimer said. These groups went on to become active in surrounding areas and in southern Saxony.The state of Saxony has also long been a stronghold of the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD) and later the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. In state elections in September, support for the AfD surged, up 17.8% from 2014 to finish on 27.5%. Dresden is also where the anti-Islam Pegida (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamisation of the West) movement began in 2014, and where it continues to hold rallies. Pegida supporters say people need to \"wake up\" to the threat of Islamist extremists. They want Germany to curb immigration and accuse the authorities of failing to enforce existing laws.The movement has spurred large counter-rallies in the city. '}\n"

      "China has \"removed\" several senior officials over their handling of the coronavirus outbreak - as the death toll passed 1,000.\n",
      "The party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission, and the head of the commission, were among those who lost their jobs.\n",
      "They are the most senior officials to be demoted so far.\n",
      "The deputy director of the local Red Cross was also removed for \"dereliction of duty\" over \"handling of donations\".\n",
      "The two Hubei party officials will be replaced by a national figure - the deputy director of China's National Health Commission, Wang Hesheng.\n",
      "On Monday, some 103 died in Hubei province alone, a daily record, and the national death toll is now 1,016. \n",
      "But the number of new infections nationally was down almost 20% from the day before, from 3,062 to 2,478.\n",
      "Hubei's health commission confirmed 2,097 new cases in the province on Monday, down from 2,618 the previous day. \n",
      "According to state media, there have been hundreds of sackings, investigations and warnings across Hubei and other provinces during the outbreak.\n",
      "But removal from a certain role - while regarded as a censure - does not always mean the person will be sacked entirely, as it can also mean demotion. \n",
      "As well as being removed from their posts, officials can also be punished by the ruling Communist Party.\n",
      "For example, the deputy head of the Red Cross, Zhang Qin, was given \"a serious intra-Party warning as well as a serious administrative demerit\", state media said.\n",
      "Earlier this month, the deputy head of the Wuhan bureau of statistics was removed, also with a \"serious intra-party warning as well as a serious administrative demerit for violating relevant regulations to distribute face masks\".\n",
      "The head of the health commission of Huanggang, the second-worst hit city in Hubei after Wuhan, has also been removed. \n",
      "In recent days, Chinese authorities have increasingly been criticised for their handling of the crisis. \n",
      "The death of a doctor whose early warnings were suppressed by authorities sparked widespread public anger. \n",
      "Beijing has sent a team from its highest anti-corruption agency to Hubei to investigate the treatment of Dr Li by police. \n",
      "There are now more than 42,200 confirmed cases across China, in the country's gravest public health crisis since the Sars outbreak in 2002-3.\n",
      "The Hubei health commission said the province had a total of 31,728 cases with 974 deaths by the end of Monday - a fatality rate of 3%. \n",
      "More than three-quarters of the deaths have been in Hubei's provincial capital, Wuhan, the centre of the outbreak. The city of 11 million has been in lockdown for weeks.\n",
      "In Hong Kong, 23 households were evacuated from an estate on Monday night, and taken into quarantine, after cases were detected there.\n",
      "The territory has had months of protests and chief executive Carrie Lam said: \"In order to fight this virus, Hong Kong needs the full cooperation and active participation of every member of society. \n",
      "\"This is a time for social cohesion; this is a time for everyone of us to display civic responsibility.\"\n",
      "In the UK, four new cases were announced on Monday - taking the total number of people infected in the country to eight. \n",
      "The government issued new powers in England to keep people in quarantine, but the overall risk level in the UK remains \"moderate\".\n",
      "Meanwhile, 65 more people have tested positive on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship moored off Japan - meaning 135 out of 3,700 passengers have caught the virus.\n",
      "Thailand on Tuesday did not allow passengers from another cruise ship to disembark, despite no confirmed infections aboard.\n",
      "The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. \n",
      "Frequent hand washing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, can help cut the risk of infection.\n",

      "Nissan is the latest car maker to temporarily shut one of its factories as it can't get parts from China.\n",
      "The firm will halt production for two days at a plant in Japan which makes the Serena and X-Trail models.\n",
      "Global car brands are facing similar disruptions as much of China's manufacturing sector remains locked down due to the deadly coronavirus.\n",
      "Hyundai temporarily closed its factories in South Korea last week due to a shortage of Chinese parts.\n",
      "In fact, many of the world's biggest car makers are dealing with dwindling supplies as factories across China remain closed.\n",
      "China is the world's manufacturing powerhouse and a major part of the global supply chain for the automotive industry, making key parts and components. Hubei, where the coronavirus outbreak first started, is a major car manufacturing hub.\n",
      "Last week, Fiat Chrysler said it was considering halting production at one of its European plants due to difficulty in sourcing parts from China. It joins a long list of car brands that rely on Chinese exports.\n",
      "''It only takes one missing part to stop a line,\" said Mike Dunne, a consultant to the car industry in Asia.\n",
      "Many factories and car plants were due to reopen on Monday after an extended Chinese New Year break. Some restarted production, but others remained closed due to local authority restrictions and lack of workers. Nissan expects to restart production in China on 17 February.\n",
      "In a statement, Nissan said: \"Due to supply shortages of parts from China, Nissan Kyushu in Japan will carry out temporary production adjustments on February 14 and 17.\" It stressed there was no impact on its other Japanese factories.\n",
      "Nissan is part of a French-Japanese strategic partnership that includes Renault and Mitsubishi. \n",
      "China has launched an app that allows people to check whether they have been at risk of catching the coronavirus.\n",
      "The 'close contact detector' tells users if they have been near a person who has been confirmed or suspected of having the virus.\n",
      "People identified as being at risk are advised to stay at home and inform local health authorities.\n",
      "The technology shines a light on the Chinese government's close surveillance of its population.\n",
      "To make an inquiry users scan a Quick Response (QR) code on their smartphones using apps like the payment service Alipay or social media platform WeChat.\n",
      "Once the new app is registered with a phone number, users are asked to enter their name and ID number. Every registered phone number can then be used to check the status of up to three ID numbers.\n",
      "The app was jointly developed by government departments and the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and supported by data from health and transport authorities, according to the state-run news agency Xinhua.\n",
      "It is widely known that the Chinese government conducts high levels of surveillance on its citizens but experts in the field suggest, in this case at least, it will not be seen as controversial within the country.\n",
      "Hong Kong-based technology lawyer at the law firm DLA Piper Carolyn Bigg told the BBC: \"In China, and across Asia, data is not seen as something to be locked down, it's something that can be used. Provided it's done in a transparent way, with consent where needed.\"\n",
      "\"From a Chinese perspective this is a really useful service for people... It's a really powerful tool that really shows the power of data being used for good,\" she added.\n",
      "The Chinese government defines 'close contact' as coming near to, with no effective protection, confirmed, suspected or mild cases of the coronavirus while the person was ill, even if they were showing no symptoms at the time.\n",
      "'Close contact' covers:\n",
      "For example, all air passengers within three rows of an infected person, as well as cabin staff, are seen as being in close contact, while other passengers would be recorded as having general contact.\n",
      "When it comes to air-conditioned trains, all passengers and crew members in the same carriage are regarded as being in close contact.\n",
      "Super-spreading, where individual patients pass on an infection to large numbers of people, is a feature of nearly every outbreak. \n",
      "It is not their fault but can have a significant impact on how diseases spread.\n",
      "There are reports of super-spreading during the new coronavirus outbreak, which has centred on Wuhan, in China. \n",
      "A British man who had been in Singapore has been linked to four cases in the UK, five in France and possibly one in Majorca.\n",
      "Coronavirus claims 97 lives in one day\n",
      "Four more people diagnosed in UK\n",
      "How worried should we be?\n",
      "What it does to the body\n",
      "It is a bit of a vague term, with no strict scientific definition. \n",
      "But it is when a patient infects significantly more people than usual.\n",
      "On average, each person infected with the new coronavirus is passing it on to between two and three other people. \n",
      "But this is only an average; some people will pass it on to nobody while others pass their infection on to far more. \n",
      "Massive - and they can have a huge effect on an outbreak. \n",
      "In 2015, a super-spreading event led to 82 people being infected from a single hospital patient with Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers), a coronavirus distantly related to the current virus\n",
      "And in the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, the vast majority of cases (61%) came from just a tiny handful of patients (3%). \n",
      "\"There were more than 100 new chains of transmission from just one funeral in June 2014,\" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, from King's College London, says.\n",
      "Some just come into contact with far more people - either because of their job or where they live - and that means they can spread more of the disease, whether or not they themselves have symptoms. \n",
      "\"Kids are good at that - that's why closing schools can be a good measure,\" Dr John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says.\n",
      "\"Commercial sex workers were very important in spreading HIV,\" Prof Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, says .\n",
      "Others are \"super-shedders\", who release unusually large amounts of virus (or other bug) from their bodies, so anybody coming into contact with them is more likely to become infected.\n",
      "Hospitals treating severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) became a major centre of super-spreading because the sickest patients were also the most infectious and they came into contact with lots of healthcare workers. \n",
      "\"It plays a big role at the beginning of any outbreak, when the virus is trying to get established,\" Dr Edmunds told BBC News. \n",
      "New infections, including the coronavirus, come from animals.\n",
      "When it makes the jump into the first patient, the disease might fizzle out before it can cause a large outbreak.\n",
      "But if it can quickly find its way into a super-spreader, then it gives the outbreak a boost. The same rules apply when cases are imported into other countries. \n",
      "\"If you have several super-spreaders in close proximity, you're going to struggle to contain your outbreak,\" Dr MacDermott says.\n",
      "Super-spreading of the new coronavirus would not be a surprise and will not significantly change how the disease is managed. \n",
      "At the moment, we are completely reliant on identifying cases and anyone they have come into contact with quickly.\n",
      "\"It makes that even more important - you can't afford too many mistakes, you can't afford to miss the super-spreader,\" Prof Woolhouse says.\n",
      "Historically, there has been a tendency to demonise the super-spreader.\n",
      "\"Typhoid Mary\", Irish cook Mary Mallon (1869-1938), unknowingly passed on typhoid fever when she had no symptoms and ended up spending decades in exile and forced quarantine.\n",
      "But in reality, it's not the patient's fault.\n",
      "\"We need to be careful of the language we use,\" Dr MacDermott says.\n",
      "\"They haven't done anything wrong, this is an infection picked up through no fault of their own.\n",
      "\"They're probably afraid and need love and attention.\"\n",

      "A crisis within the world's greatest humanitarian emergency could be reaching breaking point over the control of lifesaving aid millions of Yemenis need to survive. \n",
      "Major donors and some of the world's biggest aid agencies will meet in Brussels on Thursday in an effort to forge a collective response to what is being widely described as unprecedented and unacceptable obstruction by Houthi authorities who hold sway over large swathes of northern Yemen. \n",
      "The lives of millions of Yemenis depend on it.  A recent Yemen briefing to the UN Security Council underlined that access constraints were affecting 6.7 million Yemenis who needed assistance - a figure which it noted has \"never been so high.\"\n",
      "\"Humanitarian agencies must operate in an environment where they can uphold humanitarian principles,\" says Lise Grande, the UN's Resident Humanitarian Coordinator in Yemen. \n",
      "\"If we reach a point where the operating environment doesn't allow us to do that, we do everything we can to change it.\"\n",
      "Even at this eleventh hour, discussions are continuing with senior Houthi officials to find a way forward. \n",
      "Months of meetings, a succession of envoys despatched to the capital Sana'a, and a series of statements to the UN Security Council have failed to resolve a catalogue of complaints ranging from delays in permits to harassment and detention of staff. One aid official expressed concern over an \"extremely hostile environment\".\n",
      "Concern spiked when a levy on every aid agency was proposed, amounting to 2% of operational budgets, by the body established to exert greater control over aid known as the Supreme Council for the Management and Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (SCMCHA).\n",
      "\"This is huge,\" explains one aid official who, like most agencies operating in Yemen, did not wish to speak on the record given the acute sensitivity of these issues. \"It could be seen as financing the war.\"\n",
      "\"We don't want any disagreements with aid agencies,\" insists Man'e Al Assal who heads SCMCHA's Department of International Cooperation.  \n",
      "\"We informed them that if we work together towards a common goal to help people in need then we will not disagree, but not if they bring in political considerations,\" he tells me when we meet in Sana'a where Houthi rebels, officially known as Ansar Allah, have been in charge since 2014. His words underscore an atmosphere often clouded by suspicion and criticism of major western aid agencies and their spending priorities.\n",
      "As for the tax, he explains \"there should be nothing wrong with providing funds which enable us to coordinate aid when we're suffering from a blockade,\" a reference to restrictions imposed on air and sea ports by the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis aligned to Iran. He then hastens to add the tax is still only a proposal.\n",
      "We're surrounded by towering stacks of boxes in a vast warehouse at Sana'a International Airport, a spot chosen by Al-Assal to make his point as forcefully as possible. \n",
      "\"When this aid comes, like these expired medicines or spoilt food, we stop this aid so we don't make Yemenis sick, or add to the tragedy,\" he says, pointing to medicine belonging to an international medical charity. \n",
      "When I point out that the pallet next to us has an expiry date of June 2020, he explains that by the time the required paperwork is complete, and distribution underway, they will no longer be fit for purpose.\n",
      "Conversations with several international NGOs working in northern Yemen all relayed the same story: goods stuck in warehouses while paper work drags on; agreements delayed; permits denied. \n",
      "Some governments have been reluctant to take drastic steps, worried it could adversely affect embryonic efforts to bring an end to Yemen's devastating war which now encompass secret talks between senior Saudi and Houthi officials. \n",
      "But major donors are reported to be increasingly uneasy over perceived compromises to humanitarian principles including misuse of tax payers' money.   \n",
      "There is double jeopardy in a country where aid is a lifeline for 80% of the population. \"I'm losing sleep over this,\" one official confesses. \"Can we walk away from millions of people who, without aid, could easily slip into famine?\"\n",
      "The stakes are so high, the emphasis at this week's meeting will be on agreeing a unified response with possible options including a scaling back or suspension of aid programmes. \"The UK is urging the UN to lead on a plan - alongside other donors - for how we can all adjust how we give aid to ensure it gets to those in need,\" a spokesperson for Britain's Department of International Development (DFID) tells me. \n",
      "\"We may have to go in a different direction for a little while until we can get those conditions back in place. That's our responsibility,\" comments the UN's Grande who plays a leading role in constant discussions with senior Houthi officials to protect a programme which reaches more than 14 million people. \"We are committed to find ways to cooperate.\" \n",
      "Aid agencies also express concern about new and growing impediments in southern Yemen, which is controlled by the coalition backed government. But the constraints are still on a far less significant scale. \n",
      "On a visit to the north western province of Hajjah, one of the areas worst affected by war, disease and displacement, we're invited by another senior Houthi official to see one of their key exhibits in this standoff. \n",
      "\"When you see worms and insects in these bags, is this edible for humans? \"angrily demands Alaan Fadayil, the senior SCMCHA official in Hajjah as he rips open a sack of wheat flour.\n",
      "In this warehouse we're shown swarms of insects scurrying from bags imprinted with the blue logo of the UN's World Food Programme. The WFP admits that a very small percentage of food - in its biggest operation anywhere in the world - can go bad and they have ways to dispose of it. But it also underlines that it's been seeking permits for many months to distribute this flour. \n",
      "From there, we're taken to a much bigger storage facility a short distance away.\n",
      "Its soaring steel gate is tightly locked with two bulky industrial padlocks. But Mr Fadayil, defiantly positioned at this entrance in his sharp blue suit, insists the keys are on their way. \n",
      "We notice the upper half of this storage facility is painted in the UN's distinctive turquoise blue and realise this is where the UN recently said its red line was crossed when some of its grain supplies were looted.\n",
      "\"The quantity taken out of this warehouse was done with the authority of the attorney general to distribute some of it to people who are suffering,\" Mr Fadayil explains, brandishing a sheaf of documents with official stamps.\n",
      "Last year, the WFP suspended food aid for three months in one neighbourhood of Sana'a - an urban community where it was hoped the impact could be contained. That move was provoked by disagreements over a new biometric system intended to ensure aid reached those in greatest need amid charges that food was being diverted, including to Houthi fighters. \n",
      "The pause led to some progress on moving forward with the new system.\n",
      "\"We suffered a lot, a lot,\" one resident tells us when we visit the neighbourhood. Leaning on a metal crutch, he sighs \"we really hope they don't stop aid again,\" as a crowd grows around us, all wondering and worrying over what could happen next.  \n",
      "Australia's High Court has said Aboriginal people hold a special status under the law so cannot be deported - even if they are not citizens.\n",
      "The ruling is being seen as a historic moment for the recognition of Australia's first inhabitants.\n",
      "The case relates to an appeal against deportation launched by two men who claim Aboriginal heritage but have foreign citizenship.\n",
      "Aboriginal Australians were the first inhabitants of Australia.\n",
      "They lived in the country for at least 47,000 years before the arrival of European settlers, and subsequently suffered centuries of violence, oppression, land theft, and marginalisation. \n",
      "Brendan Thoms and Daniel Love - who had no prior connection - were born in New Zealand and Papua New Guinea respectively but moved to Australia as children.\n",
      "Each man has Aboriginal heritage and one Australian parent. Both have children who are Australian citizens and were themselves permanent residents. \n",
      "The two men both had criminal records and had both served jail sentences for violent assault.\n",
      "Under controversial Australian laws, foreigners - or aliens - must lose their right to live and work in the country if they are sentenced to a year or more in prison. \n",
      "Both men had their visas cancelled in 2018, but appealed against the order.\n",
      "The High Court had been asked to rule for the first time on whether, as indigenous people, Love and Thoms could really be considered \"aliens\" under the constitution. \n",
      "The men's lawyers argued that the men could not be considered alien because of their deep ancestral roots to Australia. \n",
      "The judges ruled four to three that Aboriginal Australians were \"not within the reach\" of the constitutional references to foreign citizens.\n",
      "\"Aboriginal Australians have a special cultural, historical and spiritual connection with the territory of Australia, which is central to their traditional laws and customs and which is recognised by the common law,\" said the ruling.\n",
      "The existence of that connection, they said, meant Aboriginal Australians could not be classed as \"alien\" under the law. \n",
      "The ruling essentially creates a new category of person under the law of \"non-alien, non-citizen\".\n",
      "Claire Gibbs, a lawyer for the two men, told reporters afterwards: \"This case isn't about citizenship, it is about who belongs here.\n",
      "\"What this means, and what the real significance of this case is, is that Aboriginal people, regardless of where they are born, will have protection from deportation.\"\n",
      "For Brendan Thoms the issue is clear cut - he has been released from detention and will not be deported to New Zealand. \n",
      "He comes from the Gunggari people, and has legally recognised traditional rights to Gunggari land.\n",
      "\"Brendan has had 500 sleepless nights worrying he could be deported at any time, and that is now thankfully at an end,\" said Ms Gibbs.\n",
      "\"He is very happy to have been released and to now be reunited with his family at long last.\"\n",
      "However it remains unclear what this means for Daniel Love. \n",
      "He comes from the Kamileroi people, but the judges could not agree whether he had been accepted as a member of the tribe, so qualified for the special status. \n",
      "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians make up about 3% of the population, and are among the nation's most disadvantaged.\n",
      "Consistent government reports have found that indigenous people are disadvantaged across the board, from child mortality rates and life expectancy, to literacy, academic success and employment rates.\n",
      "Australia has never reached a treaty with its indigenous peoples, which many argue this would bring important recognition. Work has begun on a treaty in the state of Victoria.\n",

      "\"People want different politics, new politics and better government - a new government - and I believe Sinn Féin will be the core of that,\" she told reporters in Dublin.\n",
      "\"I may well be the next taoiseach,\" she added.\n",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mrs McDonald also said she believed constitutional change was coming.\n",
      "\"The point has been conceded in the Good Friday agreement by the British state - the presence here is solely on the basis of consent,\" she said.\n",
      "\"That consent can only be tested in a unity referendum and we are going to have a unity referendum - and I want us to do it in an orderly, thoughtful democratic and absolutely peaceful manner.\"\n",
      "Sinn Féin's vice-president, Michelle O'Neill, said the party would have \"asks in terms of the republican project\", in line with its repeated calls for the next government to prepare for Irish unity.\n",
      "Left-leaning Sinn Féin managed to successfully tap into the public anger felt in the Republic of Ireland over issues that have dogged centre-right Fine Gael for a number of years - a shortage of housing, rocketing rents and homelessness, analysts suggest.\n",
      "That is despite the fact the country is forecast to have one of the fastest growing economies in the EU in 2020.\n",
      "They were dubbed \"the problems of success\" by former Finance Minister Michael Noonan as far back as 2015. \n",
      "Brexit - a considerable focus of Leo Varadkar and his deputy Simon Coveney while in power - barely registered as an issue in the campaign. \n",
      "Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster, whose party is in a power-sharing government with Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland, said younger voters had backed Sinn Féin as a \"protest vote\". \n",
      "\"From a Northern Ireland perspective we will have to work with whoever the government is in the Republic of Ireland,\" Mrs Foster told BBC News NI.\n",
      "She also said Sinn Féin may have their focus on Northern Ireland questioned, in the way there had been a \"wailing and gnashing of teeth\" over her party's confidence-and-supply agreement with the previous Conservative government in the UK. \n",
      "Sinn Féin's best-ever result is the success story of this election. \n",
      "However, with how the overall votes have fallen, we know that Sinn Féin will not necessarily end up in government despite its swathe of victories.\n",
      "The magic number for winning a majority government in the Republic of Ireland is 80 seats.\n",
      "None of the three big parties - Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and now Sinn Féin - will come close to that figure.\n",
      "Attempts to form a new coalition-of-sorts will formally get under way, although this will be complex.\n",
      "Previous administrations in the Republic of Ireland have been forged this way too, but it's taken a while to get there.\n",
      "In 2016, it took 70 days for a government to be formed after the parties agreed a confidence-and-supply agreement, which saw a Fine Gael-only cabinet, propped up by Fianna Fáil votes on key policy areas.\n",
      "Read more of Jayne's analysis here. \n",
      "Sinn Féin's vote has increased dramatically - winning 37 seats out of the 42 seats it stood candidates in and topping the poll in 30 constituencies.\n",
      "Following the last election in 2016 Sinn Féin had 23 seats in the Dáil.\n",
      "Fine Gael has been in government since 2011, firstly with the Labour Party and then with independents and since 2016, a confidence-and-supply deal with Fianna Fáil.\n",
      "It looks set to lose seats for the second election in a row, but that does not necessarily rule it out of forming another government.\n",
      "Its share of first preference votes dropped from 25.5% at the last election to 20.9%.\n",
      "The taoiseach said he was \"not really\" disappointed that he did not top the poll in his own constituency. He did get an increase in his votes compared to the last election.\n",
      "He added it was clear there was now a \"three-party system\".\n",
      "On Sunday Micheál Martin said reports suggested his party \"would be the largest\" but that it was early days and that he respected the will of the people.\n",
      "The Green Party has increased the number of seats it holds, jumping from two seats in the last election to 10.\n",
      "Green leader Eamon Ryan, who was elected for Dublin Bay South, said his party would play its part in talks to form a government.\n",
      "The Green Party secured 7.1% of first preference votes, followed by Labour (4.4%), Social Democrats (2.9%), Solidarity-People Before Profit (2.6%).\n",
      "Aontú (1.9%) independents (12.2%) and others (1.3%) accounted for the rest.\n",
      "Heavy rains in New South Wales in recent days have led to hopes that all the bushfires in the Australian state could be out by the end of the week.\n",
      "Since Friday, parts of the fire-ravaged Australian state have experienced their heaviest rainfall in years.\n",
      "The rain caused widespread flooding - hundreds of people had to be rescued, including one man stranded in a tree.\n",
      "The deluge has also extinguished 30 fires, leaving only four \"uncontained\", said the NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS).\n",
      "In total, 24 fires remain burning across the state.\n",
      "\"Given the forecast, we should be able to get on top of those relatively quickly and set the fires down,\" RFS spokesman James Morris told the BBC.\n",
      "\"We are hoping by the end of the week we may be able to have zero uncontained fires across NSW,\" he said.\n",
      "Officials have renewed wet weather warnings for parts of the coast and the neighbouring state of Queensland, but said the heaviest downpours had passed by Tuesday.\n",
      "Rain has significantly assisted reducing the fire activity across areas of NSW. It is a welcome relief for communities and firefighters alike. 26 bush and grass fires are still burning across the state with 4 not yet contained (Snowy Valley and Monaro areas). #nswrfs #nswfires pic.twitter.com/w3aUaPsuZw\n",
      "End of Twitter post  by @NSWRFS\n",
      "Since Friday, Australia's largest city, Sydney, has received 391.6mm of rain - the equivalent of a four month total, said the Bureau of Meteorology. \n",
      "Emergency response services in NSW said they had received about 10,000 calls across the state on Monday as wild weather brought down trees, flooded homes and disrupted public transport.\n",
      "Among the hundreds of rescues carried out, emergency workers saved one man from a flooded river in the state's north. He had been swept away and survived by clinging to a tree for 10 hours.\n",
      "In another rescue north of Brisbane, a man and woman were saved after they were also spotted clinging to a tree. They had been swept away from their campsite on a blow-up mattress, authorities said.\n",
      "As the rain eased overnight, crews began to clear up landslides across the coast and started restoring power to more than 100,000 homes.\n",
      "Two \"mega fires\" north and south of Sydney were officially extinguished by the drenching, officials said. Both fires had been burning since November, and had scorched around 500,000 hectares each. \n",
      "On Tuesday, NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmon said 800 firefighters had been diverted to help with the storm clean-up effort, while only 100 firefighters remained at active fire grounds.\n",
      "He said the blazes still burning were located further inland in  Snowy Valley and Monaro regions, which had missed much of the coastal rains.\n",
      "While the fire season was not over yet, he said the prolonged drenching had helped dampen the landscape.\n",
      "\"We can still expect the odd, hot, dry and windy day but it's going to be on top of a landscape that is considerably different than where we were only a matter of weeks ago,\" Mr Fitzsimmons told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n",
      "NSW has been the state most devastated in the bushfires crisis this year. The unprecedented scale and intensity of the blazes is a direct effect of climate change, scientists say, with rising temperatures leading to hotter, drier conditions across the country.\n",
      "Nationally, blazes have killed at least 33 people and destroyed thousands of homes. More than 11 million hectares of land - an area comparable to the size of England - has been affected.\n"

      "One week after the US election race began in chaotic fashion, the contest moves on to New Hampshire on Tuesday.\n",
      "Voters in the tiny north-eastern state are choosing their preferred nominees for the 2020 presidential election race in a primary contest.\n",
      "Bernie Sanders, a liberal firebrand, appears best placed to perform well in New Hampshire.\n",
      "Results from the first Democratic contest last week, in Iowa, were held up by technical glitches.\n",
      "Here's what to expect in New Hampshire.\n",
      "Joe Biden might have expected to arrive in New Hampshire in more buoyant form.\n",
      "He was among the frontrunners in the opening Iowa caucuses last Monday but in the end, he lagged well behind. The aim of the primaries and caucuses is to win as many delegates as possible across all states and territories, in order to be confirmed as the candidate. But in Iowa, the former vice-president claimed fewer delegates than rivals Mr Sanders, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren.\n",
      "Realistically, it's a competition for third place between Mr Biden and Ms Warren in New Hampshire. A poor performance there could put them both on the back foot only two states into primary season, and it's unusual (though not unprecedented) for someone to win the candidacy from such a position.\n",
      "But it's not all bad news for Mr Biden - he is more popular in states that are more diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire, and the next two contests are in states with large Latino and African-American populations, Nevada and South Carolina.\n",
      "New Hampshire's contest is not like Iowa's - these are primaries, not caucuses like in Iowa. The difference? Caucuses are a convoluted process, where people gather for a few hours for a party meeting and vote publicly in stages. They require quite a bit of commitment.\n",
      "Primary voters, on the other hand, can just turn up at a polling booth and vote in secret. Then leave. As a result, participation will be much higher.\n",
      "And because primary voters make their choice using pencil and paper, there should be none of the technical headaches we saw in Iowa.\n",
      "Is Bernie Sanders electable? We asked two voters in New Hampshire - the daughter is a big Bernie fan, the father a lapsed supporter.\n",
      "By the time you're reading this, some voters may already have cast their ballot in the middle of the night.\n",
      "Quirks of the New Hampshire electoral system mean that places with a certain amount of residents can vote when they like. So the residents of three hamlets - including Dixville Notch, near the Canadian border - will vote at midnight, as is traditional.\n",
      "Until recently, Dixville Notch had only four residents, which would not have been enough for it to vote at early. Then one resident decided to move back, and everything was OK again.\n",
      "For some of the candidates already trailing at the bottom of the pack, it could all come down to what happens in New Hampshire.\n",
      "There are still 11 Democratic candidates running, and while plenty could still happen during primary season, a poor performance could spell the beginning of the end (or even the end of the end) for the likes of Deval Patrick, Tulsi Gabbard and Andrew Yang, three weeks before 14 states vote on Super Tuesday.\n",
      "One outsider who is staking a lot on New Hampshire is Michael Bennet - the Colorado senator has held 50 town hall meetings in New Hampshire in the past two months.\n",
      "\"We're hoping to propel Michael from New Hampshire into Super Tuesday,\" his spokeswoman Shannon Beckham told the Denver Post last week, citing growing crowds. But Mr Bennet, a moderate, has struggled to get his campaign off the ground in a crowded field.\n",
      "\"We have a newcomer in the White House, and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.\"\n",
      "Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar was one of many candidates to take aim on Mr Buttigieg at a debate in New Hampshire on Friday night, four days after he performed stronger than expected in Iowa.\n",
      "His status sits somewhere between the man to beat and the new kid on the block. His rivals are now testing out lines of attack against him - one of the main ones being that his experience (as the mayor of a smallish city in Indiana) isn't enough to prepare him for the presidency.\n",
      "But, as the BBC's Anthony Zurcher reports, Mayor Pete may well appeal to New Hampshire's many independent voters. A good showing there could put him in the driving seat for the Democratic nomination.\n",
