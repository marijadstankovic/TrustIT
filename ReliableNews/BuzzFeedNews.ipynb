      "This is The Royal Tea, BuzzFeed News' newsletter where you can get your royals news and analysis before anyone else. Sign up here.\n",
      "Last week, Prince Charles walked past Vice President Mike Pence at an event in Jerusalem without shaking his hand and inadvertently sparked a ton of drama. I broke down this Royal Snub That Wasn’t in an earlier edition of this newsletter. Here it is, ICYMI.\n",
      "Despite the overwhelming evidence that nothing shady happened, people seem to believe in this “snub” anyway. If you do a quick Google search for “Prince Charles” and “Mike Pence,” you’re going to see hundreds of stories about it.\n",
      "Snubgate is the latest example of a pervasive narrative that has been playing out in the press, and especially on social media, over the past four years. The central claim is the royal family detests Donald Trump on both a personal and political level. Every interaction between Trump and the royals is analyzed by his detractors, who eagerly pounce on innocuous details as incontrovertible “proof.”For example, a clip of Charles scratching his eye while greeting the Trumps at a NATO reception in December was slowed down so that it appeared he was flipping the president off.\n",
      "The future King of England flipped off Donald J. Trump today.\n",
      "I know. I know.\n",
      "Another clip from the receiving line went even more viral. After the Queen ended her conversation with the Trumps, she motioned to Princess Anne who shrugged her shoulders in response. The interaction was interpreted on social media as the princess “snubbing” Trump.But, according to a reporter in the room, it was a perfectly innocent exchange.\n",
      "However, the biggest “proof” of subtle royal disfavor has been the supposed “signals” and “shade” that the Queen has telegraphed through her sartorial choices during her interactions with the Trumps. (I personally find these theories to be the most ludicrous of the “Queen hates Trump” rumors.) It all started with the brooches she wore during the president’s three-day visit to the UK in June 2018.\n",
      "I’m not going to go into exhaustive detail here — I highly suggest you read this post from the Court Jeweller blog. The tl;dr is that the Queen wore a brooch that had been gifted to her by the Obamas on the first day, a brooch she inherited from her mother on the second day (the only day she and Trump hung out IRL), and a brooch from the governor general of Canada on the third day.\n",
      "The Obama and Canada brooches supposedly sent a “message” to Trump about her preference for his predecessors and distaste for his anti-Canada rhetoric (although it is unclear how Trump was supposed to receive this message, since, again, she didn’t meet with him on these days). The brooch she wore when she actually met Trump? Well, because it was worn by the Queen Mother in the famous “three Queens in mourning” photo, it was clearly meant to symbolize that the Queen was grieving the pre-Trump America.\n",
      "The Queen’s choice of jewels, this time a tiara, once again made headlines during Trump’s official state visit in 2019.\n",
      "The Queen wore a piece known as the Burmese Ruby Tiara, which features rubies she received as a wedding gift from the people of Myanmar (formerly Burma). Per the jewelers, the number of rubies in the tiara is significant because “rubies in Burmese culture protect from illness and evil, in this case to protect the wearer from the 96 diseases that can afflict humans.”\n",
      "I’m sure you can imagine what came next. Tons of headlines that the Queen was “shading” Trump by wearing a tiara to “protect her.”Yeah, no. The royal blogs that monitor the Queen’s extensive jewelry collection keep track of what she wears to every single event. They show the Queen wears the same accessories for lots of different occasions. For example, look at this list of all of the occasions where the Queen has worn the brooch she wore with Trump.This sort of context matters. If you’re going to read some kind of meaning into the Queen’s jewelry choices, you have to apply that same meaning unilaterally. When you do that, these theories all fall apart.For even more on this, the Queen’s senior dresser, adviser, wardrobe curator, and in-house designer of 25 years recently wrote a book that goes into the sovereign’s sartorial choices. She makes it clear that the Burmese Ruby Tiara at the Trump state banquet wasn’t shade.So, now that we’ve looked at all of the examples above, let’s address the reason at the core of why you’re not going to see a member of the monarchy “shading” political leaders, no matter how much you’d like them to. Being royal is a job that demands absolute political neutrality, and this neutral diplomacy is a valuable asset for UK politicians. Right now, at the dawn of Brexit, one of those key UK international interests is a strong US alliance — and trade deal. It’s really unlikely that the royals would make even the subtlest of anti-Trump gestures at this point in time.\n",
      "So why do people keep saying there’s shade?I think it has something to do with this: Trump’s haters say that he’s an embarrassment to the country, and his behavior is undignified and inappropriate for a world leader. There is no figure who embodies these intangible ideals of class, dignity, and power on the world stage more than the Queen.So, to Trump’s detractors, if the royal family objects to Trump personally, that is indisputable proof that he is so horrible that he has shocked this ancient institution out of its neutrality.Sorry, y’all, but that’s not going to happen.To conclude this rather long discourse on royal shade, allow me to leave you with my very favorite royals GIF of all time, which shows a rare triple royal side-eye during an entirely nonpolitical event.\n",
      "(I know this footage is from an official engagement at luxury London food store Fortnum & Mason on March 1, 2012, and I have spent the past 7 years and 10 months wondering what in the world they were looking at.)Do you have any questions about the royal family that you’d like answered in a future newsletter?

      "Jessica Mann arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court.\n",
      "A former aspiring actor testified Friday that Harvey Weinstein forced oral sex on her, raped her, and then manipulated her into a sexually humiliating relationship, which she said included him wanting to film her having sex, urinating on her, and asking if she liked his “big Jewish dick.”\n",
      "Jessica Mann, 34, a former actor and the youngest victim to testify so far, said Weinstein raped her in his hotel room in 2013. Weinstein’s lawyers have previously indicated they will use Mann’s friendly text messages and emails to try and prove she had a consensual sexual relationship with their client, which benefited her professionally. However, Mann clarified in her testimony that she sent him several “complimentary” emails because she knew how fragile his ego was and she feared his temper.\n",
      "“He was like Jekyll and Hyde,” she said.\n",
      "Mann’s allegations are part of the rape charges against the disgraced Hollywood producer. The criminal indictment charges Weinstein with sexually assaulting Mann and Mimi Haley, who testified earlier this week. The testimonies of four other women, including Annabella Sciorra, will be used to show a pattern of abuse and bolster the predatory sexual assault charge he faces.\n",
      "Mann grew up in Washington state and was an aspiring actor when she first met Weinstein at a party in 2013. Mann told the court that she grew up in an “extremely religious pentecostal cult,” adding that she left home when she was 16 to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles.Mann was struggling with breaking into the industry, she said, recounting a period where she was homeless and living out of her car. When she met Weinstein, she said, he told her that he liked her look and would help her get parts in movies.In the weeks that followed, Mann said she saw Weinstein several times, including for dinners. One day in early 2013, at his Peninsula hotel suite, Mann said Weinstein first asked her for a massage.\n",
      "“He made me feel stupid, like why was I making such a big deal about this?” Mann said, adding that she “smeared the lotion around a bit” on Weinstein and then left the room.\n",
      "Over the next month, she said Weinstein continued to ask her to meet for coffee, go to movie premieres, and even offered her a Marchesa dress — the designer label owned by his then-wife, Georgina Chapman.\n",
      "“He told me I reminded him of his wife, because we were both clumsy,” she said. “But he told me that I was prettier.”\n",
      "Jessica Mann arrives at court.\n",
      "A few weeks later, Mann said that she and a friend met Weinstein at his room at the Mondrian hotel in LA, where he said he had a script for Vampire Academy, a film he told them they would make perfect lead actors for.\n",
      "Once there, Man said that he called her into his bedroom at the suite, grabbed her by the arm, pushed her onto the bed, and forced oral sex on her, while her friend was in the other room.\n",
      "During her testimony Weinstein was seen laughing in the courtroom when Mann recounted that she faked an orgasm and told Weinstein it was the best she ever had as a way to get out of there.\n",
      "Mann testified that she felt confused about what had happened and attempted to maintain a relationship with Weinstein\n",
      "“I had been sexual with very few people, and I couldn’t undo what had already happened,” she said, adding that their relationship became “strictly degrading from that point.”Mann, who testified in court for several hours Friday, described her encounters with Weinstein in harrowing detail, including him forcibly urinating on her, asking her how she liked his “big Jewish dick” and coercing her to have a threesome.\n",
      "Mann said she was deeply conflicted at the time, testifying that she felt compassion for Weinstein when she first saw him naked, because he had “scarring like a burn victim, no testicles, and what appeared to be a vagina.”\n",
      "When Mann said this, Weinstein was seen in court closing his eyes and shaking his head.\n",
      "“I thought his anger came from a place of pain. I did continue to see him even though I did not desire him sexually,” she said. “There are many likable things about him when he’s his nice self. He’s sort of a genius in his own way,” she stammered through tears.Mann testified that Weinstein raped her on two more occasions after that, at the DoubleTree Hotel in New York, where Mann said she first realized that Weinstein had been injecting himself with a medication for erectile dysfunction.When Mann later attempted to end her relationship with Weinstein because she had fallen in love with someone, she said he grew increasingly violent.“When he heard that he was an actor, his eyes changed and it was like he wasn’t there,” Mann said.\n",
      "After that, Mann said Weinstein was the most violent that he’d ever been, dragging her off her chair, ripping her jeans off her body, and leaving deep scars on her thighs.\n",
      "“At one point it became too much and I blacked out. When I came to, he was ejaculating in my mouth.”\n",
      "As he was leaving court Friday afternoon, a reporter asked Weinstein what he thought about the way Mann described his body.\n",
      "\"Wait to see what the lawyers say about her,\" he responded.\n",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will cross-examine Mann on Monday.\n",

      "A White House task force announced a nationwide public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak Friday, triggering mandatory quarantines for US citizens traveling from the epicenter of the disease in China's Hubei province.\n",
      "In a presidential proclamation, the task force also announced that President Trump would be barring foreign nationals traveling from China from entering the US. Relatives of US citizens would be allowed entry.\n",
      "The orders will take effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. ET.\n",
      "\"It really is intended to stop the spread of this virus,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said at a White House briefing on the announcement. He added that the current risk of the virus for people in the US is \"low.\"\n",
      "Under the order, US travelers from Hubei province in China would face mandatory quarantines of up to 14 days in screening centers, while travelers from elsewhere in China would be asked to self-quarantine at home.\n",
      "\"We still have a low risk to the American public,\" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony Fauci. \"But we want to keep it at a low risk.\"\n",
      "As justification for the steps, Fauci and Redfield cited the still-unknown incubation period for the virus, and its newly confirmed ability to infect new people while patients don't display symptoms. \"We don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted,\" said Redfield.\n",
      "Asked about the daily changes to US travel warnings and restrictions in the outbreak, microbiologist Matthew Frieman of the university of Maryland School of Medicine referenced boxer Mike Tyson's famous adage that \"everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face.\"\n",
      "\"We haven't been punched in the face,\" Frieman said. \"But China has taken one.\" Recent studies pointing to transmission of the virus early in an infection and the case of an infection occurring on US soil widens the potential for an outbreak, he said. \"I would think they are taking these steps out of an overabundance of caution.\"\n",
      "US airlines have halted flights to and from China, and discussions are underway with Chinese carriers on how to implement screening of passengers.\n",
      "And on Thursday, the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a global health emergency but said that move was intended to steer medical screening assistance to smaller nations, not to trigger travel restrictions.\n",
      "The Trump administration's new travel restrictions and quarantine efforts have led some experts to criticize the measures as an overreach.\n",
      "\"This is exactly what WHO warned against,\" said global health law expert Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University.\n",
      "Gostin said the move to quarantine travelers coming from Hubei Province was reasonable, given case numbers there, but that the requirement should have been for voluntary home isolation instead of mandatory detention. And barring foreign travelers from China, along with making US citizens self-quarantine at home, he said, likely violated civil rights laws, without leading to any real lowered risk of a US outbreak.\n",
      "\"We are slipping from overconfidence into panic and overreaction,\" said Gostin.\n",
      "Amesh Adjala of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, speaking for the Infectious Disease Society of America, said that \"decades\" of research show that travel bans are actually counterproductive in derailing outbreaks. They lead to difficulties getting resources to outbreak centers, bankruptcy, and economic hardship there, and cause stigma for residents from the affected areas.\n",
      "\"It's kind of frustrating that we always have these kind of discussions during every outbreak, no matter how many experts explain why it causes negative consequences,\" Adjala said. \"I think it is a bad turn of events.\"\n",
      "This post has been dated with expert comment on the national emergency declaration, quarantine, and travel restrictions.\n"

      "Union was dropped as a judge from the talent competition in November after she reportedly raised concerns about a racist and sexist culture at the show. In December, NBC launched a formal investigation into America's Got Talent following a Variety report that Union's contract had not been renewed after she reported a racist joke to producers and said that she was told her hairstyles were “too black” for viewers.\n",

      "Democrats had argued forcefully for witnesses, saying the trial will lack all legitimacy if none are called. But Republicans raised a variety of counterarguments. They argued the House should have completed its court battle with the Trump administration over whether it can subpoena witnesses in defiance of the White House. They also said calling witnesses in the Senate would lead to a court battle lasting weeks or months, preventing the Senate from conducting normal business.\n",

      "On Thursday, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff offered a compromise, in which the Senate would hear from witnesses for just one week — the same as in former president Bill Clinton’s trial — but that was rejected.\n",
      "News of Bolton’s memoir broke Sunday and threw the Senate into disarray. Democrats used it to mount a pressure campaign for calling witnesses, and for a few days it looked like that might happen. Republicans were openly musing about what witnesses they might call to pair with Bolton being called by House lawyers. They also talked about wanting to at least see the Bolton manuscript.\n",
      "But in the end, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was able to convince his conference to block witnesses, laying the groundwork for Republicans to acquit the president in the next few days.\n",

      "This is The Royal Tea, BuzzFeed News' newsletter where you can get your royals news and analysis before anyone else. Sign up here.\n",
      "Last week, Prince Charles walked past Vice President Mike Pence at an event in Jerusalem without shaking his hand and inadvertently sparked a ton of drama. I broke down this Royal Snub That Wasn’t in an earlier edition of this newsletter. Here it is, ICYMI.\n",
      "Despite the overwhelming evidence that nothing shady happened, people seem to believe in this “snub” anyway. If you do a quick Google search for “Prince Charles” and “Mike Pence,” you’re going to see hundreds of stories about it.\n",
      "Snubgate is the latest example of a pervasive narrative that has been playing out in the press, and especially on social media, over the past four years. The central claim is the royal family detests Donald Trump on both a personal and political level. Every interaction between Trump and the royals is analyzed by his detractors, who eagerly pounce on innocuous details as incontrovertible “proof.”For example, a clip of Charles scratching his eye while greeting the Trumps at a NATO reception in December was slowed down so that it appeared he was flipping the president off.\n",
      "The future King of England flipped off Donald J. Trump today.\n",
      "I know. I know.\n",
      "Another clip from the receiving line went even more viral. After the Queen ended her conversation with the Trumps, she motioned to Princess Anne who shrugged her shoulders in response. The interaction was interpreted on social media as the princess “snubbing” Trump.But, according to a reporter in the room, it was a perfectly innocent exchange.\n",
      "However, the biggest “proof” of subtle royal disfavor has been the supposed “signals” and “shade” that the Queen has telegraphed through her sartorial choices during her interactions with the Trumps. (I personally find these theories to be the most ludicrous of the “Queen hates Trump” rumors.) It all started with the brooches she wore during the president’s three-day visit to the UK in June 2018.\n",
      "I’m not going to go into exhaustive detail here — I highly suggest you read this post from the Court Jeweller blog. The tl;dr is that the Queen wore a brooch that had been gifted to her by the Obamas on the first day, a brooch she inherited from her mother on the second day (the only day she and Trump hung out IRL), and a brooch from the governor general of Canada on the third day.\n",
      "The Obama and Canada brooches supposedly sent a “message” to Trump about her preference for his predecessors and distaste for his anti-Canada rhetoric (although it is unclear how Trump was supposed to receive this message, since, again, she didn’t meet with him on these days). The brooch she wore when she actually met Trump? Well, because it was worn by the Queen Mother in the famous “three Queens in mourning” photo, it was clearly meant to symbolize that the Queen was grieving the pre-Trump America.\n",
      "The Queen’s choice of jewels, this time a tiara, once again made headlines during Trump’s official state visit in 2019.\n",
      "The Queen wore a piece known as the Burmese Ruby Tiara, which features rubies she received as a wedding gift from the people of Myanmar (formerly Burma). Per the jewelers, the number of rubies in the tiara is significant because “rubies in Burmese culture protect from illness and evil, in this case to protect the wearer from the 96 diseases that can afflict humans.”\n",
      "I’m sure you can imagine what came next. Tons of headlines that the Queen was “shading” Trump by wearing a tiara to “protect her.”Yeah, no. The royal blogs that monitor the Queen’s extensive jewelry collection keep track of what she wears to every single event. They show the Queen wears the same accessories for lots of different occasions. For example, look at this list of all of the occasions where the Queen has worn the brooch she wore with Trump.This sort of context matters. If you’re going to read some kind of meaning into the Queen’s jewelry choices, you have to apply that same meaning unilaterally. When you do that, these theories all fall apart.For even more on this, the Queen’s senior dresser, adviser, wardrobe curator, and in-house designer of 25 years recently wrote a book that goes into the sovereign’s sartorial choices. She makes it clear that the Burmese Ruby Tiara at the Trump state banquet wasn’t shade.So, now that we’ve looked at all of the examples above, let’s address the reason at the core of why you’re not going to see a member of the monarchy “shading” political leaders, no matter how much you’d like them to. Being royal is a job that demands absolute political neutrality, and this neutral diplomacy is a valuable asset for UK politicians. Right now, at the dawn of Brexit, one of those key UK international interests is a strong US alliance — and trade deal. It’s really unlikely that the royals would make even the subtlest of anti-Trump gestures at this point in time.\n",
      "So why do people keep saying there’s shade?I think it has something to do with this: Trump’s haters say that he’s an embarrassment to the country, and his behavior is undignified and inappropriate for a world leader. There is no figure who embodies these intangible ideals of class, dignity, and power on the world stage more than the Queen.So, to Trump’s detractors, if the royal family objects to Trump personally, that is indisputable proof that he is so horrible that he has shocked this ancient institution out of its neutrality.Sorry, y’all, but that’s not going to happen.To conclude this rather long discourse on royal shade, allow me to leave you with my very favorite royals GIF of all time, which shows a rare triple royal side-eye during an entirely nonpolitical event.\n",
      "(I know this footage is from an official engagement at luxury London food store Fortnum & Mason on March 1, 2012, and I have spent the past 7 years and 10 months wondering what in the world they were looking at.)Do you have any questions about the royal family that you’d like answered in a future newsletter?

      "Jessica Mann arrives at Manhattan Supreme Court.\n",
      "A former aspiring actor testified Friday that Harvey Weinstein forced oral sex on her, raped her, and then manipulated her into a sexually humiliating relationship, which she said included him wanting to film her having sex, urinating on her, and asking if she liked his “big Jewish dick.”\n",
      "Jessica Mann, 34, a former actor and the youngest victim to testify so far, said Weinstein raped her in his hotel room in 2013. Weinstein’s lawyers have previously indicated they will use Mann’s friendly text messages and emails to try and prove she had a consensual sexual relationship with their client, which benefited her professionally. However, Mann clarified in her testimony that she sent him several “complimentary” emails because she knew how fragile his ego was and she feared his temper.\n",
      "“He was like Jekyll and Hyde,” she said.\n",
      "Mann’s allegations are part of the rape charges against the disgraced Hollywood producer. The criminal indictment charges Weinstein with sexually assaulting Mann and Mimi Haley, who testified earlier this week. The testimonies of four other women, including Annabella Sciorra, will be used to show a pattern of abuse and bolster the predatory sexual assault charge he faces.\n",
      "Mann grew up in Washington state and was an aspiring actor when she first met Weinstein at a party in 2013. Mann told the court that she grew up in an “extremely religious pentecostal cult,” adding that she left home when she was 16 to pursue an acting career in Los Angeles.Mann was struggling with breaking into the industry, she said, recounting a period where she was homeless and living out of her car. When she met Weinstein, she said, he told her that he liked her look and would help her get parts in movies.In the weeks that followed, Mann said she saw Weinstein several times, including for dinners. One day in early 2013, at his Peninsula hotel suite, Mann said Weinstein first asked her for a massage.\n",
      "“He made me feel stupid, like why was I making such a big deal about this?” Mann said, adding that she “smeared the lotion around a bit” on Weinstein and then left the room.\n",
      "Over the next month, she said Weinstein continued to ask her to meet for coffee, go to movie premieres, and even offered her a Marchesa dress — the designer label owned by his then-wife, Georgina Chapman.\n",
      "“He told me I reminded him of his wife, because we were both clumsy,” she said. “But he told me that I was prettier.”\n",
      "Jessica Mann arrives at court.\n",
      "A few weeks later, Mann said that she and a friend met Weinstein at his room at the Mondrian hotel in LA, where he said he had a script for Vampire Academy, a film he told them they would make perfect lead actors for.\n",
      "Once there, Man said that he called her into his bedroom at the suite, grabbed her by the arm, pushed her onto the bed, and forced oral sex on her, while her friend was in the other room.\n",
      "During her testimony Weinstein was seen laughing in the courtroom when Mann recounted that she faked an orgasm and told Weinstein it was the best she ever had as a way to get out of there.\n",
      "Mann testified that she felt confused about what had happened and attempted to maintain a relationship with Weinstein\n",
      "“I had been sexual with very few people, and I couldn’t undo what had already happened,” she said, adding that their relationship became “strictly degrading from that point.”Mann, who testified in court for several hours Friday, described her encounters with Weinstein in harrowing detail, including him forcibly urinating on her, asking her how she liked his “big Jewish dick” and coercing her to have a threesome.\n",
      "Mann said she was deeply conflicted at the time, testifying that she felt compassion for Weinstein when she first saw him naked, because he had “scarring like a burn victim, no testicles, and what appeared to be a vagina.”\n",
      "When Mann said this, Weinstein was seen in court closing his eyes and shaking his head.\n",
      "“I thought his anger came from a place of pain. I did continue to see him even though I did not desire him sexually,” she said. “There are many likable things about him when he’s his nice self. He’s sort of a genius in his own way,” she stammered through tears.Mann testified that Weinstein raped her on two more occasions after that, at the DoubleTree Hotel in New York, where Mann said she first realized that Weinstein had been injecting himself with a medication for erectile dysfunction.When Mann later attempted to end her relationship with Weinstein because she had fallen in love with someone, she said he grew increasingly violent.“When he heard that he was an actor, his eyes changed and it was like he wasn’t there,” Mann said.\n",
      "After that, Mann said Weinstein was the most violent that he’d ever been, dragging her off her chair, ripping her jeans off her body, and leaving deep scars on her thighs.\n",
      "“At one point it became too much and I blacked out. When I came to, he was ejaculating in my mouth.”\n",
      "As he was leaving court Friday afternoon, a reporter asked Weinstein what he thought about the way Mann described his body.\n",
      "\"Wait to see what the lawyers say about her,\" he responded.\n",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will cross-examine Mann on Monday.\n",

      "A White House task force announced a nationwide public health emergency over the coronavirus outbreak Friday, triggering mandatory quarantines for US citizens traveling from the epicenter of the disease in China's Hubei province.\n",
      "In a presidential proclamation, the task force also announced that President Trump would be barring foreign nationals traveling from China from entering the US. Relatives of US citizens would be allowed entry.\n",
      "The orders will take effect on Sunday at 5 p.m. ET.\n",
      "\"It really is intended to stop the spread of this virus,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield said at a White House briefing on the announcement. He added that the current risk of the virus for people in the US is \"low.\"\n",
      "Under the order, US travelers from Hubei province in China would face mandatory quarantines of up to 14 days in screening centers, while travelers from elsewhere in China would be asked to self-quarantine at home.\n",
      "\"We still have a low risk to the American public,\" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony Fauci. \"But we want to keep it at a low risk.\"\n",
      "As justification for the steps, Fauci and Redfield cited the still-unknown incubation period for the virus, and its newly confirmed ability to infect new people while patients don't display symptoms. \"We don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted,\" said Redfield.\n",
      "Asked about the daily changes to US travel warnings and restrictions in the outbreak, microbiologist Matthew Frieman of the university of Maryland School of Medicine referenced boxer Mike Tyson's famous adage that \"everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face.\"\n",
      "\"We haven't been punched in the face,\" Frieman said. \"But China has taken one.\" Recent studies pointing to transmission of the virus early in an infection and the case of an infection occurring on US soil widens the potential for an outbreak, he said. \"I would think they are taking these steps out of an overabundance of caution.\"\n",
      "US airlines have halted flights to and from China, and discussions are underway with Chinese carriers on how to implement screening of passengers.\n",
      "And on Thursday, the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak a global health emergency but said that move was intended to steer medical screening assistance to smaller nations, not to trigger travel restrictions.\n",
      "The Trump administration's new travel restrictions and quarantine efforts have led some experts to criticize the measures as an overreach.\n",
      "\"This is exactly what WHO warned against,\" said global health law expert Lawrence Gostin of Georgetown University.\n",
      "Gostin said the move to quarantine travelers coming from Hubei Province was reasonable, given case numbers there, but that the requirement should have been for voluntary home isolation instead of mandatory detention. And barring foreign travelers from China, along with making US citizens self-quarantine at home, he said, likely violated civil rights laws, without leading to any real lowered risk of a US outbreak.\n",
      "\"We are slipping from overconfidence into panic and overreaction,\" said Gostin.\n",
      "Amesh Adjala of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, speaking for the Infectious Disease Society of America, said that \"decades\" of research show that travel bans are actually counterproductive in derailing outbreaks. They lead to difficulties getting resources to outbreak centers, bankruptcy, and economic hardship there, and cause stigma for residents from the affected areas.\n",
      "\"It's kind of frustrating that we always have these kind of discussions during every outbreak, no matter how many experts explain why it causes negative consequences,\" Adjala said. \"I think it is a bad turn of events.\"\n",
      "This post has been dated with expert comment on the national emergency declaration, quarantine, and travel restrictions.\n"

      "Actor Terry Crews has apologized for praising America's Got Talent and not standing by former judge Gabrielle Union, who was dropped from the show for reportedly calling out its toxic work environment, which included allegations of sexism and racism.\n",
      "\"@itsgabrielleu, I want you to know it was never my intention to invalidate your experience— but that is what I did.

      "Union was dropped as a judge from the talent competition in November after she reportedly raised concerns about a racist and sexist culture at the show. In December, NBC launched a formal investigation into America's Got Talent following a Variety report that Union's contract had not been renewed after she reported a racist joke to producers and said that she was told her hairstyles were “too black” for viewers.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — After days of arguments and questioning in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial, many Republican senators have come to the same conclusion: The president did it, and they don’t care.\n",
      "House Democrats voted to impeach Trump on claims he abused his power by withholding military aid to Ukraine in exchange for announcing an investigation into political rival Joe Biden. Democrats also argued that the president had stonewalled the House’s investigation, which led to the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress.\n",
      "Democrats in both the House and Senate now want to subpoena additional witnesses after reports that former national security adviser John Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone have firsthand knowledge of the request. But Senate Republicans, now in their second week of a trial to convict the president, think Trump should stay put no matter what.\n",
      "The Impeachment Today podcast gets you up to date with the day’s most important impeachment news. Catch up on all the episodes, or subscribe on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows.\n",
      "Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee posted a 15-tweet thread Thursday night calling the president’s handling of aid to Ukraine “inappropriate,” acknowledging that Democrats had proven Trump did exactly what he was accused of — but, he said, it’s not impeachable.\n",
      "“There is no need for more evidence to prove that the president asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son, Hunter; he said this on television on October 3, 2019, and during his July 25, 2019, telephone call with the president of Ukraine,” the senator tweeted. “There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens; the House managers have proved this with what they call a ‘mountain of overwhelming evidence.’”\n",
      "But, Alexander argued, even if the president did it, the decision of what to do about it should be left to voters in the 2020 election. “The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate,” he wrote.\n",
      "Alexander wasn’t alone in that opinion. “Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office,” Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said in a statement Friday.\n",
      "Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio echoed that line, saying in a statement of his own, “I believe that some of the president’s actions in this case — asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine — were wrong and inappropriate.”\n",
      "But, Portman went on to say, “I do not believe the president’s actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election.”\n",
      "Even Trump’s own legal team has laid out an argument for senators to acquit the president regardless of him withholding military aid from Ukraine for political gain. Over hours of opening statements and responses to written questions, White House lawyers argued that most if not all presidential actions have “mixed motives” that factor in both politics and the public good.\n",
      "“Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest. And mostly you’re right,” White House lawyer Alan Dershowitz told senators. “Your election is in the public interest. And if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.”\n",
      "That argument resonated with some of the president’s strongest defenders. Sens. Mike Braun and Tim Scott, two Republicans who have spoken to reporters in the Capitol often throughout the trial, have taken up the \"mixed motives\" line. They argue that the president’s dealings were legitimate because Trump honestly believed he was rooting out corruption, even if his actions had the effect of damaging a possible presidential rival.\n",
      "Trump’s defense went even further Wednesday, arguing that it is perfectly fine for a president to accept election help from a foreign country.\n",
      "“If there is credible information, credible information of wrongdoing by someone who is running for a public office, it's not campaign interference for credible information about wrongdoing to be brought to light if it is credible information,” White House Deputy Counsel Patrick Philbin argued during the Senate trial. “So I think the idea that any information that happens to come from overseas is necessarily campaign interference is a mistake.”\n",
      "Senators will vote Friday on whether to allow witnesses in the trial, a vote that is likely to fail. Republicans are then expected to vote to acquit Trump on all charges as soon as Friday evening.\n"
