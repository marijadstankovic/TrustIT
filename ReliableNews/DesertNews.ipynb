      "SALT LAKE CITY — Throughout the preseason and even now a month into competition, much of the discussion surrounding Utah’s gymnastics team has centered on what the Red Rocks lost.\n",
      "There have been countless mentions of the 14 routines that Utah had to replace this year — here’s another one — routines that were performed by superstar gymnasts MyKayla Skinner and MaKenna Merrell-Giles, not to mention key contributors in Kari Lee, Macey Roberts and Shannon McNatt. \n",
      "There has also been talk of the end of the Marsden era at Utah, what with the retirement of legendary coach Megan Marsden last spring.\n",
      "It is all understandable discussion to be sure, but with the season about to move into its second month and Utah ranked No. 4 in the nation, it’s time to look at what the Red Rocks gained.\n",
      "The easiest answer would be some incredibly productive freshmen, namely Maile O’Keefe and Abby Paulson. O’Keefe has been Utah’s sole all-arounder, won her first collegiate all-around competition against Arizona State and was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Week as a result. Paulson, meanwhile, has scored a 9.9 in every meet and is one of just two Red Rocks, the other being senior Kim Tessen, to pull off that feat this season.\n",
      "About Arizona\n",
      "Coach: John Court (3rd Season)\n",
      "Record: 5-2, 0-1 Pac-12\n",
      "Notes: The Wildcats scored a season-high 196.150 in their loss to Oregon State last week. ... 11 gymnasts earned season-highs and six earned career-high scores in that setback. … Arizona scored the 49-plus on vault, beam, and floor against the Beavers, all of which were season highs. … Maddi Leydin made her season debut in the all-around against OSU and won the vault title with a 9.90. … Christina Berg ranks No. 30 nationally on bars, with an average score of 9.869. Her season-high on the event is 9.90.\n",
      "Another answer could center on sophomores Cristal Isa and Cammy Hall, who are in reality in their first year of competition up on the hill. Isa has arguably been Utah’s most reliable gymnast and is averaging around a 9.85 on both balance beam and floor exercise. Hall, for her part, has been one of Utah’s more successful vaulters after returning from a ruptured Achilles.\n",
      "You can also bring up junior Emilie LeBlanc, the transfer from Maryland who has led off the uneven bars and beam lineups all season and is coming off her best meet as a Ute. \n",
      "Then there are assistant coaches Carly Dockendorf, Courtney McCool Griffeth and Garrett Griffeth.\n",
      "Head coach Tom Farden remade the Utah coaching staff during the offseason when he promoted Dockendorf to assistant and brought in Garrett and Courtney as assistant and volunteer assistant coaches, respectively. Behind the scenes, the trio have already made a significant impact on the program.\n",
      "The Yurchenko 1.5 that Burch performed to great success against Arizona State last weekend? A side effect of Garrett Griffeth’s work on vault. The Utes’ excellence on beam this year, where they are ranked No. 5 in the country and are far and away the best team in the Pac-12? A line can be drawn directly to Dockendorf. \n",
      "\n",
      "    Related\n",
      "  \n",
      "The team’s continued excellence on floor, where the Red Rocks are ranked No. 6 nationally and are just a hair behind the pace set by the record-breaking floor lineups of the past two seasons? Credit has to go, in large part, to Courtney Griffeth. \n",
      "“The common thread that all of them have is they are very passionate about coaching gymnastics and coaching at the highest level,” Farden said. “All three of them are extremely hard workers. For as little time as our staff has been together, I feel like we’ve done a good job.”\n",
      "Each has brought something different to the team. \n",
      "Garrett Griffeth, who Farden compared to Greg Marsden due to his not being a former gymnast himself, has proven approachable and has given the vault team a “quiet confidence” while asking them to do bigger and more difficult vaults.\n",
      "“He is a student of the sport,” said Farden. “Sometimes when you’ve never done the sport you have to study even harder. He unearths things and is willing to learn from everybody and has a really good perspective.”\n",
      "That has already made him a beloved part of the team.\n",
      "“I love Garrett,” Tessen said. “With Garrett, you’ll do something and you can have a good conversation about it. With him it is a ‘we’ll figure it out together’ type thing.”\n",
      "Dockendorth, meanwhile, is low-key hypercompetitive, which shows up in the Red Rocks’ beam work.\n",
      "“Carly is a very aggressive coach,” junior Sydney Soloski said. “She is not about playing it safe and going up and doing a clean routine. For example, Carly is not afraid to have Cristal throw the triple series every time or have a D mount. Cristal doesn’t need any of it — she has seven or eight tenths bonuses in her routine — but Carly is really aggressive in her approach to coaching. On beam we have definitely upgraded skillwise. We aren’t playing it safe and that is paying off for us.”\n",
      "Her background with the team — Dockendorf is in her third season at Utah — has made her universally well-liked too.\n",
      "“I know a lot of the girls, me as well, get along with Carly really well,” said Tessen.\n",
      "As for Courtney Griffeth, she might be the most enigmatic of the bunch. A former Olympian, she does things that Farden, a veteran of the sport, has never seen, balancing an acute attention to detail — intense is a word thrown around by a few gymnasts — with an extremely supportive nature.\n",
      "“Courtney is a little more intense, and inspirational if you want to call it that,” senior Missy Reinstadtler said.\n",
      "“Courtney is incredible with her details,” said Farden. “I’ve never quite seen anybody build floor routines like she does. It has been really fun and eye-opening for me. She is very creative in how she builds floor routines and is great individually with each kid and is attentive to their needs.”\n",
      "Perhaps the biggest thing the three have brought to Utah is a youthful energy and optimism that has inspired an unrelenting push for improvement.\n",
      "“They brought a whole new level of gymnastics with them,” said Burch. “They are really there to challenge us to do the bigger skills, to be perfect. In a sense, they brought a more competitive nature to each event.”\n",
      "So far, with Utah improving upon its team score every week this season, the new approach is working. \n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — A record crowd at the fourth annual Silicon Slopes Tech Summit Friday set the stage for a debate among the top six Utah gubernatorial candidates, as they were each asked to tackle questions tailored to them.\n",
      "Jeff Burningham, Spencer Cox, Greg Hughes, Jon Huntsman Jr., Aimee Winder Newton and Thomas Wright took the stage at the Salt Lake Palace Convention Center stage for the first debate in the 2020 gubernatorial race. Summit organizers invited only candidates who have raised at least $50,000 in their campaigns.\n",
      "Silicon Slopes Executive Director Clint Betts moderated the event, which followed a format that dispensed with opening and closing statements and followed a flow of directed questions and answers that appeared to match topics with candidates.\n",
      "While each candidate got their own questions to respond to, one issue united all six of the people on stage.\n",
      "Their support of President Donald Trump.\n",
      "While Betts noted Cox’s occasional criticisms of the president, Utah’s lieutenant governor  said he was ultimately supportive of Trump and, later, when the question was addressed to the full slate of candidates, all acknowledged their support of the president.\n",
      "Responding to a question about his opposition to the Legislature’s failed tax reform effort, tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist Jeff Burningham said that “it’s never smart to tax business input” and called for simplifying the tax code, not adding complexity to the process.\n",
      "“We do not have a revenue problem,” Burningham said. “Entrepreneurs have ensured that we do not have a revenue problem. We have a spending problem.”\n",
      "Former Utah House Speaker Greg Hughes was asked about his promise to make gun-related legislation a priority in 2018 following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and the need for a special session to address the issue, which never occurred.\n",
      "“While there wasn’t a special session … great ideas were proffered, common ground was found,” Hughes said. “This is an ongoing issue. I would not say we did nothing.”\n",
      "Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, a prolific Twitter poster, fielded a question that went to his use of technology in general and social media in specific.\n",
      "“I ran a tech company for 10 years,” Cox noted. “Tech gives us an opportunity to connect with people. I get to have a town hall every day ... I get to listen to people and share our message.\n",
      "“I used to worry about my Twitter account until we got a new president.”\n",
      "Betts cited former Gov. Jon Huntsman, Jr.’s support of a failed attempt to institute a school voucher program — an effort roundly rejected by voters in 2017 — and asked if it was still an issue he was behind.\n",
      "“There is no more powerful a word in education than choice,” Huntsman said. “This will be my approach and it will be my mantra ... individualized education.”\n",
      "Huntsman went on to detail his belief that issuing tablet computers to every student would help advance education outcomes in the state.\n",
      "Salt Lake County Councilwoman Aimee Winder Newton got to weigh in on how she would address Utah’s current challenges with maintaining an inventory of affordable housing opportunities.\n",
      "Winder Newton said the decision to remove planning from what is now the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget was a mistake and, as governor, she would reverse that decision\n",
      "“I’m going to bring that planning component back,” Winder Newton said. \n",
      "She also said that successfully navigating the state’s continued population growth will also require giving local governments more authority over managing and overseeing growth issues at that level.\n",
      "Betts noted Thomas Wright was the only candidate to have already named a running mate, outgoing GOP Rep. Rob Bishop, and asked about the decision to make the move early.\n",
      "“Rob Bishop called and asked me if I would accept his endorsement,” Wright explained. “As I spoke to him I realized the candidate I was most afraid of running against was talking to me. \n",
      "“I didn’t make a political decision at a convention ... I made a decision based on who would be the best lieutenant governor for the state of Utah.”\n",
      "The efficacy of a program run by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development that offers post-performance tax rebates to companies that invest and create jobs in the state, rose as one of the few issues that got responses from multiple candidates.\n",
      "Betts asked Cox about criticisms that have been leveled against the GOED program that question why the state is offering tax breaks to out-of-state companies, perhaps to the detriment of Utah companies looking to expand.\n",
      "“I’m one of those people critical of GOED,” Cox said. “Why on earth would we be giving away tax income to companies to come here at 2.6% unemployment? Why would we be giving away taxpayer dollars for that?”\n",
      "Betts followed up, pressing Cox on what he’s done to change that. While Cox indicated he did not have that level of influence as lieutenant governor, Hughes jumped on the response.\n",
      "“You can’t say that you’re owning all the good things that are happening and then, when pressed, say you don’t have the influence, Hughes said. “GOED has ... to change now. Words have to match what we’re doing.”\n",
      "Huntsman was also roped into the exchange, as the GOED program was created during his time in office. The former governor said the effort was launched at a time of significantly different economic conditions and intended to create a “safe haven for capital” investment, but said the program was “probably ready for review.”\n",
      "Other notable moments included Hughes reiterating his support of the Utah Inland Port effort, Cox committing to dedicating more resources to address the state’s high youth suicide rate, and Winder Newton’s promise to address the teacher shortage.\n",
      "Neighbor co-founder and CEO Joseph Woodbury said he was happy to watch a debate that stepped away from the typical format and stayed focused on particular issues rather than the individual candidates’ platforms.\n",
      "“I think the genius of this debate, and props to Clint (Betts) for the idea, was coming out hard on all of them,” Woodbury said. “I was glad they didn’t take a single-issue approach where they pose a questions and everyone weighs in. “\n",
      "Onetime gubernatorial candidate and Overstock.com CEO Jonathan Johnson said he was glad to see that at least a portion of the candidates came from outside the political sphere.\n",
      "“Four years ago, I ran as an outsider and I’ve got a lot of respect for what Jeff (Burningham) and Thomas (Wright) are doing,” Johnson said. “I think that hill to climb is pretty hard.”\n",
      "Johnson, like Woodbury, said he also appreciated questions that were directed at individual candidates that didn’t hold back.\n",
      "“I thought Clint’s questions were fair and hard-hitting,” Johnson said. “We need more of these debates.”\n",
      "Governor’s Office of Economic Development Executive Director Val Hale also had a moment to speak following the square-off that ended up featuring issues related to his agency.\n",
      "Hale noted while he’s heard similar criticisms of post-performance rebates going to out-of-ƒstate companies, he said a solid majority of the recipients are based in Utah.\n",
      "“The overwhelming majority of (Economic Development Tax Increment Financing) awards go to Utah companies,” Hale said. “The ratio is 2 out of every 3 companies are from here in the state. If you look closer, the majority of those recipients also come from our tech sector.”\n",
      "Data from a Deseret News/Hinckley Institute of Politics poll released Friday shows marked separation of the top two candidates in the gubernatorial race from the rest of the field, but a full quarter of respondents — which included Republicans and some non-Republicans likely to participate in the primary — told pollsters they were undecided.\n",
      "Huntsman, the former U.S. ambassador to Russia, captured 33% of Republicans who say they are very likely to vote in the GOP primary election. Cox followed with 25%. All of the other candidates were in single digits, none higher than Burningham’s 5%.\n"

      "PORTLAND, Ore. — Twice in the last 65 seconds of Thursday night’s game against the Denver Nuggets Jordan Clarkson missed shots that would have made it a one-possession affair.\n",
      "To judge Clarkson or the Utah Jazz by those two shots would be a complete mischaracterization of what happened in the Jazz’s 106-100 late-night loss to the Nuggets.\n",
      "A more fair assessment would be that the Jazz were out of sorts from the opening tip and the biggest reason they were even in the game at all down the stretch was because of Clarkson, who scored 24 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter.\n",
      "“He brought us back in the game,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said afterward. “If he makes that shot it seems like he’s being aggressive and that’s what I want. He was terrific tonight.”\n",
      "From the outside there were some mixed reviews of what transpired in the home stretch of the game. Should Clarkson be the one taking those shots? Why didn’t he try to get the ball to someone else? \n",
      "From inside the Jazz locker room, there was nothing but praise and gratitude for Clarkson.\n",
      "“We wouldn’t have been there without him, he had a different look in his eye,” Donovan Mitchell said. “He was pretty bummed that he didn’t hit those shots at the end but we’ll take that shot 10 times out of 10.”\n",
      "Clarkson was not only the person the Jazz wanted taking the shots down the stretch, he was the player that had earned the right to take whatever shot he wanted on Thursday.\n",
      "The Jazz started off the night with seven first-quarter turnovers, so right off the bat things didn’t look great.\n",
      "Then, as the game went on and the Jazz corrected some of their sloppier mistakes, the Nuggets impeded their ability to run their more familiar actions and when that started to change the flow of the offense, the Jazz were forced into more isolation plays.\n",
      "Problem was that the Jazz’s most potent scorer, Mitchell, could not get his shots to fall. He finished the night with four points on a 1-of-12 outing for just his second single-digit scoring effort of the season.\n",
      "Meanwhile Clarkson put on the second-highest scoring performance of his career, behind only a 42-point night on Feb. 13 of last year while with the Cavaliers. \n",
      "“You can always be critical of a decision here and a decision there but sometimes when you’re critical, guys make those shots,” Snyder said. “He battled his tail off and he was aggressive, I thought he was really good.”\n",
      "That has seemed to be the case with Clarkson throughout his career. When he’s on, everything looks bright and cheery with talk about how much potential he has as a scorer. \n",
      "But, when things are off, the critiques always come back to Clarkson being a one-trick pony who is only out to get his own numbers and can’t operate within a system.\n",
      "To that, Snyder is ready to rewrite the narrative.\n",
      "“I love him, I love him. Write it down. I love him,” the Jazz head coach said of Clarkson. “Sometimes a system needs to be malleable. He’s unselfish, he attacks the rim, he gets to the line. If the system is defense, he’s embraced that, and I think he’ll continue to learn.”\n",
      "Snyder completely rejects the idea that Clarkson is anything other than an unselfish player who still, at age 27, has a ton of upside and untapped potential.\n",
      "Over the past couple of weeks, Snyder said he’s continued to have conversations with Clarkson about the need to be instinctive when he has the ball.\n",
      "“When he gets the ball, catch and shoot, rip it and drive it,” Snyder said. “And, he has the ability that when he does drive it, if someone cuts him off, to make a play.”\n",
      "The Nuggets had done their best to take the Jazz out of the game on Thursday. The pick-and-roll wasn’t working like it usually does for the Jazz, their kick-out actions weren’t effective, Mitchell couldn’t buy a bucket, and it all looked bleak after the Nuggets went on a 27-1 run at one point.\n",
      "Instinctively, just as Snyder had asked him to, Clarkson found opportunity in the isolation plays, went 7 of 12 from 3-point range, and brought the Jazz back to have a fighting chance.\n",
      "The fact that he missed two shots in the final 65 seconds, doesn’t tell the story, and it doesn’t give him the credit he deserves.\n",
      "\n",
      "SALT LAKE CITY — The passenger in the car that hit and killed South Salt Lake police officer David Romrell pleaded guilty Friday to a reduced charge of manslaughter.\n",
      "Jeffrey Don Black, 44, of Murray, was originally charged with murder, a first-degree felony, robbery, obstructing justice, attempted burglary and failing to stop at the command of an officer.\n",
      "On Friday, amended documents were filed in court charging Black with manslaughter and burglary, both second-degree felonies. Black waived his preliminary hearing on the new charges and pleaded guilty to both counts. In exchange for his pleas, the remaining charges of obstructing justice, burglary and failing to stop for police were dropped.\n",
      "Salt Lake County deputy district attorney Chou Chou Collins said she has been in frequent contact with Romrell’s family as well as members of the South Salt Lake and Unified police departments, and all are in agreement to the plea deal.\n",
      "About a dozen officers from those agencies sat in the courtroom Friday as Black entered his guilty pleas. They all sat around widow Elizabeth Romrell, who used a tissue to wipe away tears as Black’s defense attorneys read the facts of the case.\n",
      "On Nov. 24, 2018, Black was in the passenger seat of a car driven by Felix Anthony Calata, 32, of West Valley City, when Caltata ran over Romrell, 31, causing fatal injuries. Romrell and another officer fired upon the vehicle before it struck the officer, causing fatal injuries to Calata.\n",
      "Romrell was responding to a call of a  burglary in progress near 3575 S. West Temple. Calata was at the address to take money that he felt was owed to him from a debt, according to charging documents. He and Black were unable to make entry and were about to leave when police ordered them to stop.\n",
      "Instead, Calata hit the gas pedal and accelerated, the charges state. After his arrest, Black told police he thought they had run over a mailbox.\n",
      "Black ran from the scene after Calata was shot and his car crashed, but he was later arrested.\n",
      "Black will be sentenced on April 6. Judge Royal Hansen invited officers and Romrell’s family members to speak at the sentencing. Black will also have the option of addressing the court.\n",
      "Elizabeth Romrell left the courtroom surrounded by officers without comment. \n",

That’s where I believe it was just a part of God’s plan to leave school and follow my heart,” Thompson said. “That’s the biggest thing, just following your heart.”\n",
      "The next stop for the 22-year-old during a whirlwind part of his life? Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, where the Chiefs will face the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday (4:30 p.m. MST, TV: Fox) for the NFL championship. \n",
      "“A lot of people can give their perspective but they don’t know what God has instilled in you. That’s why I never understood the word doubt. How could you doubt me when you don’t know what God has instilled within me? I believe God and me walk hand in hand; you doubt me, you doubt God.

After picking up just five carries through the first three months of the regular season, Thompson saw his offensive role increase in December and finished his rookie year with 37 carries for 128 yards, topped by a 11-carry, 44 yard-effort in a 40-9 win over Oakland on Dec. 1, 2019, that included Thompson’s first career touchdown. He also had 10 receptions for 43 yards.\n",
      "Touches come at a premium in the Chiefs offense, led by reigning NFL MVP quarterback Patrick Mahomes, dynamic tight end Travis Kelce and speedster Tyreek Hill.\n",
      "“I averaged 12 carries per game in college, from junior college to Utah State. My pops always told me, you only need five carries to show what you can do. Within those five carries, you can either run the ball or you can’t run the ball,” Thompson said. “Playing in this offense, they do let me run the ball enough — if you had Patrick Mahomes, baby, what would you do? This is a perfect offense for me, they’ve got Patrick Mahomes opening up the running lanes. He’s a better athlete than most athletes on the other side of the ball.”\n",
      "One of Thompson’s more memorable plays this year came in the Chiefs’ playoff game against Houston, when he scooped up a fumble forced by teammate Daniel Sorensen, a former BYU standout, on a kickoff return and returned the fumble 18 yards to the Texans 6-yard line. That led to a touchdown three plays later, as Kansas City rallied from down 24-0 to win 51-31.\n",
      "“There was a guy in front of me, and everyone kinda stopped in shock. I was like, ‘Can I advance this?’ So when I knew that I could, it was time to go,” Thompson said. “For that split moment, I thought for one second, can I do this? And then boom, I just go.

You should always want more, and that’s what coach Bieniemy wants,” Thompson said. “He strives for perfection, and he makes sure he gets that out of you. He wouldn’t be the great coach that he is if it wasn’t for that. He deserves to be an NFL coach someday somewhere.” \n",

But he wants to learn the game, he wants to understand why we’re doing this, or why they say this and do that,” Williams said. “He wants to learn, and as a young kid in the NFL, those are the type of questions you should ask.

      "“That’s where you see the Hall of Famer in him, because he’s able to do that. He’s gone from playing and starting his entire career, and now he’s here to teach the young guys. He’s accepted that role. Shady is a high-class guy.” \n",
      "McCoy, like Thompson, is searching for his first Super Bowl ring. He’s a six-time Pro Bowler who led the NFL in rushing yards in 2013, and in rushing touchdowns two years before that. Earning a ring, though, would top it off.\n",
      "“There are some great players that have played this game, in all sports, and haven’t won a championship. I look back at my career, I’ve got some good stuff to be proud about, but one of the things I would really be proud about is saying Super Bowl champion, putting that on my legacy,” he said.\n",

      "“We’re chasing big things right now,” Pope said.\n",
      "The Cougars and Gaels tangle Saturday (8 p.m., MST, ESPN2) at the Marriott Center. It’s a matchup between the top two 3-point shooting teams in the country.\n",
      "Meanwhile, BYU is No. 28 in the NCAA’s NET rankings, while Saint Mary’s is No. 34. With a win, the Cougars (16-7, 5-3) will climb into a tie for second place with the Gaels (19-4, 6-2). \n",

I hope everybody’s excited to come out because this is a big-time, high-level game against a great coach, one of the best coaches in the country and a veteran team that’s won a boatload of games and is the defending conference tournament champion that’s already beat us one time this year. It’s on. It’s a big-time game. It doesn’t get much bigger than this.” \n",
      "BYU visited Saint Mary’s on Jan. 9 and, without injured forward Yoeli Childs, lost 87-84 in overtime. TJ Haws scored a game-high 29 points and Jake Toolson added 24 for the Cougars. Jordan Ford recorded 24 for the Gaels. \n",
      "“It was super tough, super painful. I just want to be out there to help my guys, really,” Childs recalled about being sidelined for that contest, the first of four due to a finger injury. “It’s been really frustrating to be out so many games this year. But I think I’ve been able to learn from it and grow from it and the team’s been able to learn and grow as well. \n",

It’s supposed to be, we come out with a real determination to get stops on every single possession,” Pope said. “We have to somehow get that fatigue and frustration that wants to get into our mind and replace it with some anger and determination. … That’s where we have to live. February, if you do it right, is not the most fun month. But if we do it right, then it’s going to be really fun to see where we get.” \n",
      "Thursday against Pepperdine, the Cougars saw a 21-point lead melt to eight at halftime. In the locker room, BYU coaches and players issued a challenge about the team’s identity. In the early moments of the second half, the Cougars quickly pushed their lead back to 20-plus points. \n",

      "Creed Cole Lujan, 43, was charged Friday in 3rd District Court with aggravated kidnapping, rape, forcible sodomy and aggravated robbery, first-degree felonies; three counts of sexual exploitation of a minor; and three counts of obstructing justice, second-degree felonies.\n",
      "Prosecutors have requested Lujan be held without bail, or in the alternative, bail be set at an extraordinarily high amount of $1.5 million cash only.\n",
      "Charging documents outline the disturbing crime.\n",
      "On Monday, a 15-year-old girl was walking home from school when Lujan pulled up next to her in his car and forced her at knifepoint to get inside, according to charging documents. Police say he then took the girl’s cellphone, “poured chemicals on it” and left it in the road.\n",
      "Lujan put duct tape over the girl’s mouth and wrapped her hands and feet in duct tape, then leaned the passenger seat back and forced the girl to lie partly on the car floor and partly on the seat, according to the charges. \n",
      "Lujan took the girl to his house, 3542 S. 6555 West, then forced her to take three pills to “relax” before taking her to a bed in the basement where he photographed and videotaped her naked before raping her, the charges state.\n",
      "Afterward, police say he took the girl to a bus stop near her school and dropped her off. She was found running through the neighborhood crying hysterically.\n",
      "Using home surveillance cameras in the area that recorded Lujan’s car, police were able to track him down at his house. His house and the interior matched descriptions given by the girl, according to the charges.\n",
      "“When police made contact with Lujan, he was actively deleting photos from his phone that appeared to be a nude female,” the charging documents say.\n",
      "Detectives said they were able to recover some of those photos, which were of the kidnapped girl. \n",
      "During an exam at the hospital, the girl tested positive for barbiturates, a sedative, which police believe was from the pills Lujan gave her. \n",
      "According to a police affidavit, Lujan told the girl that “he had cancer and that he hoped God will forgive him.”\n",
      "In 2009, Lujan pleaded guilty to attempted murder in 3rd District Court in exchange for a charge of aggravated kidnapping being dismissed. At that time, police say Lujan attempted to kill a hotel housekeeper at the Crystal Inn in West Valley City.\n",
      "In that case, Lujan requested housekeeping service in his room. When an employee came to his room, he shut the door, locked it and used a twisted hand towel to choke her until she was unconscious, according to charging documents.\n",
      "Lujan told police, “I don’t know why I did it. The cleaning lady was there in the hotel and I lost it. Is she dead? Is she dead? Is she dead?” the charges state.\n",
      "He was sentenced to three years to life in the Utah State Prison, according to court records. He was released on parole in January 2015, according to the Utah Department of Corrections.\n",

      "“I didn’t know how long I could play with the dog again, experience those late June evenings where the sun didn’t set until 10 p.m., feel the wind, experience the desolation of the mountains,” recalled Willis, 39. \n",
      "“I was at peace with my fate, but at the same time, I knew that one day I’d be fighting,” he said. \n",
      "A few years ago, as his kidney failure worsened, Willis learned how difficult it would be to receive a kidney transplant. But he still faced responsibilities like family and work. \n",
      "He received a few calls that kidneys were available, but ended up being unable to go through surgery “for one reason or another,” Willis said. \n",
      "Renal failure eventually “defeated” him, he remembered. But in November, Willis finally got the call he’d been waiting for. He received a new kidney and pancreas from a deceased donor, becoming the 3,000th person to receive a kidney transplant at Intermountain Healthcare in the 37 years since the program began. \n",
      "The health care system celebrated that milestone Friday at Intermountain Medical Center in Murray, where hospital officials described it as emblematic of the growing number of people willing to sign up to become donors. \n",
      "During the news conference, Willis thanked staff members who worked to save him, and the family of the person who saved him. \n",
      "“Everyone that I’ve encountered, you are the reason why I am alive right now. Every single one of you play a vital role in saving lives on a daily basis. And for that reason, I feel unworthy of your presence. You are all truly angels in my eyes, and I haven’t felt so safe in a long time,” Willis said. \n",
      "He urged others who are waiting to receive a transplant to be patient. \n",
      "The hospital performs an average of 100 kidney transplants per year, said Derek Ginos, director of Intermountain’s abdominal transplant program. Only about a quarter of transplant programs in the country have performed 3,000 kidney transplants, he said. \n",
      "Dr. Diane Alonso, medical director of Intermountain’s program, said “it’s up to us as a community to say yes for donation, to consider living donation and being a donor for our patients, because this disease afflicts many people, and probably touches someone that you know, or a friend of someone that you know.” \n",
      "Dr. Donald Morris, medical director for Intermountain’s kidney and pancreas transplant program, said seeing patients like Willis doing well after their transplant “is what it’s all about.”\n",
      "“It’s a unique area of medicine, where people as sick as Jeff, you’re able to do this, and you double their life expectancy compared to being stuck on dialysis,” he said. \n",
      "Morris also wanted to let people know there’s a fairly new way to donate a kidney to a loved one who’s not a match, through a national kidney exchange program that allows people to be matched up with other kidney donors.\n",
      "“That’s been exciting, and we’re really picking up steam on that. And so I think we’ll do even more living kidney transplants this year,” Morris said. \n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — At the end of the day, Kobe Bryant was a basketball player, at least for the vast majority of people, yet somehow his premature death has sent the country — even the world — into deep mourning. That says as much about us as him.\n",
      "Kobe Bryant was little more than a well-known stranger, as James Taylor once described his own celebrity in song, yet people grieved his death as if they lost a close friend or someone they knew.\n",
      "Jimmy Fallon did a bit on him during the “Tonight Show.” Fans across the country built shrines at the local NBA arena. In Boston — home of the Lakers’ dreaded rival Celtics — a towering building was lit in Laker purple and gold, as was the Empire State Building. Fans petitioned the NBA to change the NBA logo from the Jerry West silhouette to Kobe Bryant.\n",
      "NBA players started their games by taking intentional 24-second shot-clock violations and 8-second backcourt violations in honor of the two jersey numbers Bryant wore. It was reported that his loss cast a pall over the opening day of the Super Bowl festivities. NBA players took seemingly opposite paths to honor Bryant. Some abandoned their usual number to wear Bryant’s number, while others who normally wear No. 8 or No. 24 said they will wear them no more. The Pistons wore No. 8 and No. 24 jerseys in warmups. No one will ever wear those numbers for the Lakers. Bryant became the first player ever to have two jerseys retired by the same team.\n",
      "Across the world, Bryant was honored as if he were a head of state. President Obama weighed in on his passing. There is an official weeklong mourning period in Italy, where Bryant lived for seven years while his father played for Italian basketball teams. The Chinese honored him on the internet with photos and well-wishes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted his regrets on Twitter, as did France’s sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu.\n",
      "Australia’s Nick Kyrgios showed up for his match in the Australian Open wearing a Bryant jersey, and during an on-court interview his opponent, Rafael Nadal, wiped away tears and donned a Lakers hat. Last Sunday Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo posted a tribute to his 82 million followers on Twitter, and by Monday morning it had been retweeted almost 100,000 times.\n",
      "It was a remarkable display of affection for Bryant. His transformation from basketball star and sometime villain to beloved icon was complete — one that was well underway before his life was cut short.\n",
      "He was not always embraced by the public, especially outside L.A., where he played his entire 20-year career. He was flawed off and, yes, even on the court. He finished his career as the third-leading scorer in NBA history, but he scored a lot of points because he took a lot of shots. He missed more shots than anyone in history — 14,481 of them to be exact, more than 1,000 more than anyone else. He was perhaps the most physically gifted player ever (or tied with Michael Jordan), but he was also selfish on the court and tended to take bad, low-percentage shots.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Like most driven, highly successful people, he could be surly and hard on teammates. In his playing days he carried a Tiger Woods-like edgy persona. He called himself “Black Mamba,” and later revealed that he borrowed the nickname from the movie “Kill Bill,”  in which an assassin uses a black mamba snake to murder a man. “The length, the snake, the bite, the strike, the temperament,” Bryant said in a 2018 Washington Post interview. “ I looked it up — yeah, that’s me. That’s me!’”\n",
      "So Bryant was all of those things. Writer Jeremy Long got it right when he wrote in The Outline, “Kobe wasn’t the most dominant player of his generation (Shaquille O’Neal) or the most consistently successful (Tim Duncan) or even the coolest (Allen Iverson). But of all his peers, he turned winning into his brand, even when he wasn’t winning all that much.”\n",
      "Bryant was a hard-working, aggressive force of nature when it came to the game (and, we later found out, anything else he put his mind to).\n",
      "And then there was the darker stuff off the court, specifically the infamous rape case in Colorado, which made him public enemy No. 1 for a time. The woman refused to testify and charges were dismissed (and a settlement paid), but after hearing months of testimony, Bryant made a remarkable admission: “Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.”\n",
      "Maybe his struggles shouldn’t have been so shocking. Bryant entered the league at 18 years old and his prodigy came with a price; he had to grow up on the fly in a man’s world with millions of dollars and temptations at his disposal. Others in that situation failed where he eventually matured and thrived.\n",
      "There is a long, distinguished list of athletes who died too young and caused the public to pause. Roberto Clemente, Joe Delaney and Pat Tillman died heroically — Clemente while flying supplies to earthquake victims in Central America; Delaney while trying to save three drowning children in a pond even though he couldn’t swim; and Tillman while fighting in the Middle East after giving up football and millions of dollars. \n",
      "Steve Prefontaine was cut down just as he was going to become the greatest distance runner in the world. Payne Stewart, Thurman Munson and Clemente died in air crashes (and now Bryant), and Drazen Petrovic and Dale Earnhardt died in car accidents, the latter during a professional race. Closer to home, Utah State’s Wayne Estes, just months before the Lakers planned to make him their first pick, died at the scene of an auto accident. Ernie Davis and Lou Gehrig died of disease and Hank Gathers and Reggie Lewis collapsed and died on the basketball court with heart problems. Andre the Giant died for the same reason, in his sleep. Len Bias and Ken Caminiti died of drug overdoses.\n",
      "The death of these elite athletes is always shocking, as if their feats on the field had led fans to believe they were above things that took down the rest of us — illness, auto wrecks drowning. So they were mortal after all. Tyrann Mathieu, the Kansas City Chiefs’ strong safety, wrote, “You know, it’s unimaginable. I thought that guys like (Bryant) would live forever.” \n",
      "Bryant’s death seems to have reached further into the world’s collective pathos like no other, at least since perhaps Tillman, and then Clemente and Gehrig before that, but it might have even exceeded those. His death was jarring, especially for the generation that grew up with him. It cut a hole out of the culture. It leaves a void. He never got the chance to grow into the role of senior statesman a la Bill Russell and Jordan.\n",
      "Many were saddened that Bryant, who was 41, perished just as he was hitting his stride as a man. By many accounts, he had become a dedicated father, one who coached his daughter’s AAU team, and the rough edges had been worn off. He warmed up to people and reached out to help many, especially young, aspiring players. He was no longer the cold-blooded assassin, the Black Mamba. He was involved in philanthropy. He was a savvy investor and businessman. He wrote a series of children’s books. He produced an animated movie, “Dear Basketball,” which earned Bryant an Academy Award in 2018.\n",
      "He stayed above the fray that follows the NBA — for one thing, he refused to be drawn into the silly GOAT talk that obsesses LeBron James and the media; he did not care. He wanted to move beyond basketball. It was old news for him. He was pursuing other things with the same passion he brought to the game, rising before dawn just as he once did for his morning basketball workouts. He said he wanted to do more off the court in his post-basketball career than he did as a player.\n",
      "Bryant was maturing nicely and now he’s gone. He, and we, never got a chance to see where he could take it. \n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — Things aren’t the same nowadays. That, in a nutshell, is how UteZone.com publisher Dan Sorensen views Wednesday’s national signing day for Utah football.\n",
      "“This February is a lot different than what we’ve seen in previous years where I think this is the first year that Utah has really taken advantage of the early signing period,” Sorensen said. “As a result we’re going to see a lot less action on the first Wednesday in February than we normally do.”\n",
      "In December, Utah announced the signing of 22 players. The recruiting class includes South Carolina quarterback Jake Bentley, a graduate transfer, and highly touted California high school star Clark Phillips III, a cornerback who decommitted from Ohio State to sign with the Utes.\n",
      "“We feel like we are getting some really good players added to our roster,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said at the time.\n",
      "The balance of the early signees included defensive lineman Xavier Carlton (Juan Diego HS); linebacker Graham Faloona (Southlake Carroll HS, Texas); defensive lineman Van Fillinger (Corner Canyon HS); linebacker Sione Fotu (Bingham HS); offensive lineman Alex Harrison (Viewmont HS, running back); Ty Jordan (West Mesquite HS, Texas); offensive lineman Jaren Kump (Herriman HS); safety Kamo’i Latu (St. Louis HS, Hawaii); cornerback Kenzel Lawler (Eleanor Roosevelt HS, California); offensive lineman Hunter Lotulelei (Highland HS); offensive lineman Solatoa Moea’i (Punahou HS, Hawaii); wide receiver Connor O’Toole (La Cueva HS, New Mexico); wide receiver Money Parks (Aledo HS, Texas); defensive lineman Taniela Pututau (Cottonwood HS); defensive lineman Tennessee Pututau (East HS); safety Ben Renfroe (Magnolia HS, Texas); safety Nate Ritchie (Lone Peak HS); cornerback Caine Savage (Western HS, California); defensive lineman Aliki Vimahi (Kahuku HS, Hawaii); and defensive lineman Tyler Wegis (San Juan Hills HS, California).\n",
      "So with the bulk of the 2020 recruiting class in place, Sorensen said Utah has really been focused on filling the last couple of spots with the best available players, including guys intending to serve missions. The latter includes defensive lineman Keanu Tanuvasa (Mission Viejo HS, California). \n",
      "Other probable missionaries could also join the mix.\n",
      "According to UteZone.com, Utah has also secured commitments from running back John Gentry (North Shore HS, Texas), quarterback Cooper Justice (Lakeridge HS, Oregon) and cornerback Faybian Marks (George Ranch HS, Texas).\n",
      "Besides Bentley, transfers include fullback Joe Ludwig (Iowa) and kicker Skyler Southam (BYU).\n",
      "Sorensen noted that some high school defensive backs are also still being looked at, as are possible graduate transfer options at cornerback, safety or linebacker.   \n",
      "“Really it’s just about filling those very few last remaining spots that they have for initial scholarships in the class,” Sorensen said. \n",
      "The bulk of the staff’s recruiting efforts over the last couple of weeks, he added, have actually involved guys who will be seniors next season — laying a foundation for 2021.\n",
      "As for the traditional signing day in 2020, Sorensen said things are pretty quiet — more so than any of the 15 years he’s reported on recruiting — as Wednesday approaches, thanks to the early harvest.\n",
      "“We’re kind of in uncharted territory in that regard,” Sorensen said. “But at the end of the day it’s the date where the class gets wrapped up.”\n",
      "Sorensen noted that Utah has recruited well and is flirting with a top 30 national class.\n",
      "“They are going to be in that range depending on how the dominoes fall with the last uncommitted prospects,” he said. “But they’ve done a phenomenal job at identifying where the holes are and identifying where they need to reload and rebuild and really going out and getting guys that fit the program from an athletic standpoint, from an intelligent standpoint and from a cultural standpoint.”\n",

      "Imelda Staunton will play Queen Elizabeth II in the fifth and final season of The Crown. pic.twitter.com/hUOob58A9p\n",
      "“The Crown” was originally planned to last six seasons, but series creator Peter Morgan decided that season 5 was the appropriate place to end, The Guardian reported. \n",
      "“At the outset I had imagined ‘The Crown’ running for six seasons, but now that we have begun work on the stories for season 5, it has become clear to me that this is the perfect time and place to stop,” Morgan said, according to The Guardian. “I’m grateful to Netflix and Sony for supporting me in this decision.”\n",
      "In the first two seasons, the role of Queen Elizabeth was played by Claire Foy, and Olivia Colman took over for seasons 3 and 4, according to The New York Times. Foy and Colman have both won Golden Globes for their performances, and Foy won an Emmy in 2018. \n",
      "“I have loved watching ‘The Crown’ from the very start,” Staunton said in a statement shared on Twitter by “The Crown.” “As an actor it was a joy to see how both Claire Foy and Olivia Colman brought something special and unique to Peter Morgan’s scripts. I am genuinely honoured to be joining such an exceptional creative team and to be taking ‘The Crown’ to its conclusion.”\n",
      "The show’s conclusion will come before the storyline (which has detailed the life of Queen Elizabeth and the royal family) reaches the present day.\n",
      "“I feel uncomfortable writing about events within a certain time period. I think there’s a certain amount of time within which, if you write about it, what you do instantly becomes journalistic,” Morgan told Entertainment Weekly in a 2018 interview. “If you wait a certain amount of time, if you allow 15 or 20 years, basically a generation, between you and (the events) then you can write about it somewhat freely as drama. Let’s wait 20 years and see what there is to say about Meghan Markle.”\n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — Two people were arrested Friday after police say they traveled from Las Vegas to Salt Lake City to sell marijuana products at an event called “Taco Sesh.”\n",
      "Justin Rashad Marion, 23, and Medina Selimovic, 22, were arrested for investigation of multiple counts of drug-related charges.\n",
      "Police say it’s not the first time the couple has been in Utah hosting a marijuana-themed event. Both also had warrants out for their arrests for similar incidents in 2019 and 2018.\n",
      "Their latest arrests happened early Friday when detectives from the Metro Gang Unit developed information that the two were traveling to Utah from Las Vegas “to host an ‘event’ referred to as Taco Sesh. Both Marion and Selimovic made numerous posts on their individual social media accounts promoting the event in addition to advertising the ‘menu’ consisting of THC products, including raw marijuana, THC cartridges, cannabis infused edibles and psilocybin mushrooms that were going to be available at the event,” according to a police booking affidavit.\n",
      "Officers with the gang unit and the U.S. Marshal’s Violent Fugitive Apprehension Team developed information about where the event was to take place and secured a search warrant.\n",
      "Selimovic was spotted getting out of a car as officers arrived and was taken into custody. Once police announced their presence, “multiple individuals were observed fleeing from the house, including Justin Marion who was observed by detectives exiting the house and jumping a wooden fence,” the affidavit states. \n",
      "A police K-9 was used to track Marion who was found hiding in a trash can, police say.\n",
      "Inside the house where the event was taking place, investigators seized “approximately 6 pounds of raw marijuana, 1 pound of psilocybin mushrooms, approximately 150 THC cartridges, 100 grams of THC resin and 100 packages of cannabis infused edibles of various strengths,” the affidavit states.\n",
      "Both Marion and Selemovic were charged in November in 3rd District Court with drug distribution after police discovered a similar operation in the south end of Salt Lake County. At that time, Marion told police “he was upset that he was arrested for selling marijuana because he helps people with medical conditions. Marion also said that he will get more product and continue to sell marijuana when he gets out of jail,” according to charging documents. \n",
      "At the time of that arrest in July, police say Marion also had a warrant out for his arrest in Arizona. Formal charges were filed in Salt Lake City in November, and arrest warrants were issued for both Marion and Selemovic. Those warrants were still active at the time of Friday’s arrest.\n",
      "Marion and Selemovic were also key figures in a similar marijuana bust in 2018 at Beaver Mountain Lodge on April 20.  They were both charged with drug distribution and also had warrants out for their arrests for that case, according to court records.\n",

      "AMERICAN FORK — Two people were arrested and face charges associated with a massive national fraud scheme in which they are accused of convincing people, typically elderly people, into loading thousands of dollars onto Walmart gift cards, which they then allegedly used to buy other gift cards that they sold online.\n",
      "The scheme is responsible for more than $600,000 in losses to fraud victims and Walmart, according to charges filed in 4th District Court.\n",
      "Junliang Tang, 35, and Shuyan Wang, 23, were both charged with money laundering, pattern of unlawful activity and unlawful use of card, all second degree felonies. Prosecutors asked for a higher bail than usual as they see both of the accused as “serious flight risks” because they are Chinese nationals.\n",
      "Investigators say the complicated scheme typically targets elderly people and they typically pose as IRS or government agents, computer service technicians or bail bondsmen.\n",
      "A Walmart investigator said such criminals then convince people to “load large sums of money onto Walmart gift cards,” the charges state. “After the gift cards are loaded, a network of purchasers enter Walmart stores and use the fraudulently obtained Walmart gift cards to purchase other “closed loop” gift cards, such as Apple iTunes gift cards, Nintendo cards, etc. Those ‘closed loop’ gift cards are then monetized into cash through various online marketplaces.”\n",
      "A closed loop gift card is one that can only be used with a specific vendor. Those cards can, however, be monetized in other ways, including selling them online.\n",
      "The case began to come together for investigators on Jan. 22 when a Walmart loss prevention officer in Saratoga Springs contacted a detective to report that a woman had purchased $1,600 in various gift cards on her phone as payment. He provided investigators with her licence plate number, which matched the plates of a car observed days earlier working with a male suspect in Oregon, police say.\n",
      "On Jan. 23, a Walmart loss prevention officer saw a man in the same Walmart purchasing $1,800 in gift cards in several transactions. \n",
      "“The gift cards were purchased using barcodes from Walmart gift cards loaded onto the (suspect’s) cellphone,” the charges state. “This was the same method (an investigator) observed (with) the ... woman using the day before.”\n",
      "At about the same time, an American Fork police sergeant located the woman from the previous day’s incident purchasing gift cards at an American Fork Walmart, according to the charges.\n",

Tang said he was paid 1% to 2% of the total dollar amount of the gift cards he purchased and uploaded into a digital form for people in China to access,” the charges state.\n",

      "This is what playing in a Power Five league looks like, and that requires a Power Five approach. Is BYU up to the challenge?\n",
      "As athletic director Tom Holmoe told the media this week, BYU needs this challenge right now as an independent to stay relevant.\n",

      "  \n",
      "Some fans, however, complain about the front-loaded schedule, which left the team reeling at the end of 2019 due to injuries. BYU started more players (51) than anybody else in the FBS last season.\n",
      "“I don’t schedule games based on what may go wrong. I schedule games on what could go right,” Holmoe said.\n",
      "A year ago, I didn’t think the Cougars would win a game in September but thought they would go on and win the rest of their games to get to eight wins.\n",
      "Kalani Sitake’s staff and players proved me wrong. They beat a ranked USC team and grabbed an overtime win at bowl-bound Tennessee at Rocky Top. As for the other eight, the wins over No. 14 Boise State and Utah State were impressive. But inconsistencies in losses to Toledo, South Florida, SDSU and Hawaii kind of made many forget September.\n",
      "Now comes a real murderer’s row in 2020.\n",
      "The season kickoff is at 2019 11-win Utah, followed by that first-ever trip by Michigan State to Provo, then road trips to Arizona State and Minnesota. Both the Utes and Gophers were ranked in the top 10 at different points last season.\n",
      "Nobody else schedules a September like that. Nobody did it last year and I can’t see a similar matchup this coming year, opening with four P5s.\n",
      "Defending champion LSU starts its season against the University of Texas at San Antonio, two other home games and a neutral-site game against Rice.\n",
      "As Holmoe put it: “Our goals in going independent in football included the opportunity to increase our national exposure and provide better access to our football program for our national fanbase. We also wanted to schedule home-and-home games with many of the storied football programs in the country. Thanks to our relationship with ESPN, we have been able to accomplish these goals.”\n",
      "Well, BYU is hip-deep in it now, looking at 2020.\n",
      "The last two Septembers are as close as BYU fans can get to experiencing their team weigh its talents against Power Five without being a Power Five. \n",
      "Last year, nobody in the country opened up against four-straight Power Five opponents.\n",
      "Defending Pac-12 champion Oregon has a tough 2020 September, but they open up against North Dakota State before hosting Ohio State and Hawaii and then taking to the road at Colorado.\n",
      "“It means you have to strap it on,” said former BYU athletic director Glen Tuckett.\n",
      "“It means you better have depth. You need depth to play these games and you can develop depth by playing these kinds of games,” he continued. “It’s an ambitious schedule, but BYU is compelled to schedule these games early. So they have to start quickly and play well and, hopefully, the lack of depth doesn’t show up until later in the games or season.”\n",
      "The players? They like it. They didn’t back down in 2019 and won’t in 2020, regardless of the foe. Celebrations after the USC and Tennessee wins last September were loud, long and hard.\n",
      "Former Cougars QB and NFL player John Beck said playing up and outside the Mountain West was a highlight of his career.\n",
      "“I think that that schedule would be so exciting, especially as a player that was looking at the schedule when I made a commitment to play at BYU. I think all players look not only at the university itself and the program, but also who you’re going to play against. \n",
      "“Any competitor wants to know that he is playing against the best competition possible. The games that excited me the most were the biggest games on the schedule. When I was there, it was the USC and Notre Dame games. At first glance, it looks like the schedule could have some big games on it because those are some big programs.”\n",
      "With an apparent decision by Sitake to keep his coaching staff intact for 2020, that means he believes he has what it takes to get it done.\n",
      "It means he believes his developmental approach expects dividends, that his culture, work ethic, strength and conditioning, depth, and the ability of his staff to achieve consistency live within his circle.\n",
      "It means play calls and game management must be at an optimum — not perfect, but at the highest level. It means he thinks a very young team from a year ago will be more capable to make crucial plays this year under his staff, that tweaks he can make this spring will reap maximum results and efficiency.\n",
      "If that is his game plan, good luck. He has great faith.\n",
      "Now he needs work. A lot more work.\n",
      "The Pac-12 saw five offensive coordinator and five defensive coordinator changes since the 2019 season. \n",

The survey showed that 32% of registered voters would vote for Bloomberg and 45% for Trump. Another 13% weren’t sure and the remainder either would vote for someone else or not vote.\n",
      "Bloomberg held McAdams up as an example of the success Democrats can have in a Republican-dominated state like Utah during a campaign stop in Salt Lake City Jan. 18, telling a downtown crowd that Utahns “have been ignored by national Democrats for too long.” \n",
      "He said the party “shouldn’t be writing off any state, no matter how red people think it is. And after all, Democrats have shown they can win here, especially with Donald Trump in the White House.”\n",
      "In an interview with the Deseret News, Bloomberg said he intended to help McAdams, who has been targeted by Trump’s reelection campaign as well as national GOP groups.\n",
      "”We’re going to try to help him. We’ve got a staff here full time,” Bloomberg said, that includes McAdams’ campaign manager Andrew Roberts, who is serving as senior adviser to the presidential candidate’s campaign in Utah. \n",
      "Asked for specifics about aid to McAdams, Bloomberg said: “You give him some money and you go out there and talk him up when you talk yourself up, or when my staff is talking me up. You can plant stories. You do normal campaign stuff,” including assisting in getting out the vote in the 4th District.\n",

      "China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine, while foreign countries, companies and airlines have cut back severely on travel to China and quarantined those who recently passed through Wuhan. Infected people don’t show symptoms immediately and may be able to pass on the virus before they appear sick.\n",
      "Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, at least 20 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is. \n",
      "Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that constitutes a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response. \n",
      "“The main reason for this declaration is not because of what is happening in China but because of what is happening in other countries,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva. “Our greatest concern is the potential for this virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems which are ill-prepared to deal with it.\n",
      "“This declaration is not a vote of non-confidence in China,” he said. “On the contrary, WHO continues to have the confidence in China’s capacity to control the outbreak.”\n",
      "A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries. \n",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing said it was authorizing the departure of family members and all non-emergency U.S. government employees from Beijing and the consulates in the cities of Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenyang. Staff from the Wuhan consulate departed earlier this week. \n",

      "Speaking by Skype from Utah, Kelly Flanagan, 36, a school counselor in China since 2011, said she is planning to stay out of China as she watches the virus spread. \n",
      "“This is probably going to be awhile,” said Flanagan, who said her Type 1 diabetes added to her health concerns. From the U.S. she is working remotely with her students to help them pass English proficiency exams. \n",
      "Japan and Germany also advised against non-essential travel and Britain did as well, except for Hong Kong and Macao. Popular holiday and shopping destination Singapore barred Chinese from traveling there, becoming the first Southeast Asian nation to do so.\n",
      "Tedros said WHO was not recommending limiting travel or trade to China, where transport links have shut down in places and businesses including Starbucks and McDonald’s temporarily closing hundreds of shops.\n",
      "“There is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade,” he said. He added that Chinese President Xi Jinping had committed to help stop the spread of the virus beyond its borders.\n",
      "Although scientists expect to see limited transmission of the virus between people with close contact, like within families, the instances of spread to people who may have had less exposure to the virus is worrying.\n",
      "In Japan, a tour guide and bus driver became infected after escorting two tour groups from Wuhan. In Germany, five employees of German auto parts supplier Webasto became ill after a Chinese colleague visited. The woman had shown no symptoms of the virus until her flight back to China.\n",
      "“That’s the kind of transmission chain that we don’t want to see,” said Marion Koopmans, an infectious diseases specialist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands and a member of WHO’s emergency committee. \n",
      "On Friday, Thailand said a taxi driver became its first case of person-to-person spread. The Southeast Asian country, a popular travel destination for Chinese, has counted 19 cases in all. \n",
      "The new virus has now infected more people globally than were sickened during the 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, a cousin of the new virus. Both are from the coronavirus family, which also includes those that can cause the common cold.\n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — The nine-month search for a new CEO for the YWCA Utah is over as Provo native and social justice advocate Liz Owens has been named to the post.\n",
      "Owens is the current executive director of the Utah Coalition Against Sexual Assault. The announcement was posted to YWCA Utah’s website Thursday.\n",
      "“YWCA Utah has been fortunate to have had Anne Burkholder guiding its important work for the last 20 years,” said Katherine Venti, chairwoman of the transition committee. “In Liz Owens, we found an exceptional leader whose prior experience aligns seamlessly with YWCA Utah’s mission, who understands the challenging work YWCA Utah continues to do, and who will collaboratively lead YWCA Utah into its next important phase.”\n",
      "Owens’ selection was lauded by those who work with the same populations served by the YWCA, but especially those who have been critical of the organization’s ability to fully embrace its stated mission of “eliminating racism.”\n",
      "The Deseret News outlined those concerns about the YWCA and spoke with more than a dozen former board members and employees who hoped leadership changes would lead to an enhanced role for the state’s flagship organization in fighting violence against women, specifically when it came to women of color.\n",
      "“I burst into tears when I heard,” said Shannon Cox, founder and CEO of Journey of Hope, an organization that had been working with the YWCA to address the needs of previously incarcerated women, including those who were sex trafficking victims.\n",
      "Cox wrote a letter to the YWCA board criticizing the organization’s leadership for the way it handled interactions with her staff and the women they served, something they felt put vulnerable women in great peril. \n",
      "“I was hoping they would bring in someone from the outside, someone who wasn’t connected to the politics, who could see things through a completely third-party lens,” said Cox. “But I think somebody coming in from the outside wouldn’t understand the dynamics of Utah. Racism isn’t overt here.”\n",
      "After Cox spoke out about her experience, three of six board members who had resigned over the issues in 2017 spoke out to the Deseret News about the need for more attention and awareness to understanding racism and racial bias, especially that which is more subtle and easily dismissed by those not experiencing it. Those interviewed said they felt that employees of color were more likely to be targeted with hostility and punishment when they brought issues to managers. \n",
      "Among those was Carol Shifflett, a former employee who said her experience was so emotionally draining it still impacts her years later. She was thrilled with the announcement that Owens will now lead an organization that she sees as vital to the state.\n",
      "“I think it’s the best decision the YWCA has made in ages,” said Shifflett, now the CEO of Sojourner Group. “She is perfect for that position. She’s highly qualified. This is what she studied, this is what she does.”\n",
      "She lauded the decision not just for the community, but also for those employees who are so dedicated to the YWCA’s stated mission of “empowering women and eliminating racism.”\n",
      "“She will definitely make sure they meet the mission, and she’ll do it in a professional manner,” said Shifflett, who spoke with Owens just before the decision was announced. “I think she’ll change the culture for those working there, where it’s inclusive of everybody. That’s just the kind of work she does. ... I almost didn’t sleep last night I was so happy.”\n",
      "Emma Houston, who resigned her position as YWCA board secretary over leadership concerns, said there was a lot of “exciting buzz around the selection of Ms. Elizabeth Owens.” She pointed out she was one of the “30 Women to Watch in 2019.”\n",
      "“Ms. Owens has the credentials and experience to lead the YWCA Utah to the next level in Utah to fulfill its mission,” Houston said.\n",
      "Added Shifflett, “I think Liz is going to be the model for YWCAs across the United States. I believe in her work.”\n",
      "Owens is a Provo native who earned her Bachelor of Science at Utah Valley University and her Master of Arts in theory and practice of human rights from the University of Essex in the United Kingdom. Cox said her thesis was on working with incarcerated women and the issues they face.\n",
      "“I am honored to become part of the YWCA and look forward to leading this wonderful organization in its next chapter,” Owens said on the organization’s website. “I am joining an organization with a long legacy of good work in our community and have deep respect for all of those who have made YWCA Utah what it is today. I look to the future with excitement; a commitment to positive, collaborative change; and a sincere love for this work.”\n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — While the threat of coronavirus looms outside of Utah and even more heavily beyond domestic borders, Utah’s biggest immediate concern is influenza — which is also a very serious respiratory illness.\n",
      "At least two teens in Utah have died from the flu in recent weeks, according to the Utah Department of Health. Thousands of flu cases have been reported statewide, and there have been 535 influenza-related hospitalizations. The majority of them are not senior citizens or people with chronic illnesses — they’re children.\n",
      "“We have a higher percentage of kids being hospitalized this season,” said Keegan McCaffrey, influenza epidemiologist at the health department. The reason for that, he said, is because the predominant strain, influenza B, hits kids particularly hard.\n",
      "“If your child is sick, keep them home from school until 24 hours after their fever resolves,” McCaffrey said. He also said the ongoing flu season has yet to peak and it isn’t too late to get vaccinated.\n",
      "“Flu is a really serious disease,” he said. “Most people do recover, but it takes a big toll on families and the people who are hospitalized.”\n",

      "Influenza, to date, remains more infectious and more deadly than the novel coronavirus strains that popped up recently in China, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It reports that more than 173 million doses of flu vaccine have been given out in the U.S. since October — and advises that it is not too late to be vaccinated.\n",
      "Still, flu activity remains high or moderately high in nearly all 50 states, save Idaho, where it hasn’t yet hit very hard, according to the CDC.\n",
      "Utah Department of Health numbers show influenza-like illnesses are still on the rise, with high severity and widespread activity reported throughout the state. The rate of confirmed illness jumped in the last week for which data is available. The trend is still largely following activity tracks of previous years, albeit climbing a little earlier than usual because influenza season started a little earlier than previous years, McCaffrey said.\n",
      "“Risk really depends on exposure,” he said, adding that with the flu widespread in Utah, there have been no cases of coronavirus. “Right now, in Utah, people are at risk of being exposed to flu but not to coronavirus.”\n",
      "Coronavirus, however, was declared an international public health emergency by the World Health Organization on Thursday, mostly because it is so new, transmission is still very much unpredictable and the illness is not well understood. The ramped up classification legally requires states to step up their response to the crisis.\n",
      "Utah health officials announced expanded vigilance earlier this week, as well as plans to keep Utahns abreast of any further developments. There are still no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Utah, though several people are under observation, the health department reported on Wednesday.\n",

      "Other outbreaks that have reached emergency status with the WHO include the swine flu in 2009, polio and Ebola virus in 2014, Zika in 2016 and Ebola again in 2018-19. None of them infected nor killed nearly as many as influenza has and will, according to the CDC.\n",
      "While the CDC considers coronavirus a “very serious public health threat,” it points to an even larger problem with the flu, which reaches epidemic proportions every year.\n",
      "The agency reports an increase in positive respiratory specimens this week over last, as well as more people visiting the doctor for influenza-like illnesses and symptoms — all typical for this time of year.\n",
      "The CDC estimates that 19 million to 26 million people have been sick with the flu since Oct. 1. And while influenza-related deaths are often underreported, the CDC believes up to 20,000 Americans will die with the flu this year.\n",
      "McCaffrey said it is the third year of the last six where influenza has been severe in Utah, but the predominant strain hasn’t been influenza B, thus infecting as many kids, since 1992.\n",
      "“Were in the middle of flu season now,” McCaffrey said. “A flu shot is still going to protect you.”\n",

      "LOS ANGELES — The Utah basketball team played one of its better defensive games of the season Thursday night at the Galen Center in holding an explosive USC team to just 56 points on 37.3% field-goal shooting.\n",
      "The Utes limited the Trojans’ leading scorer, Onyeka Okongwu, to just 11 points on nine shots and their second-leading scorer Jonah Mathews to 2-of-9 shooting.\n",
      "“I was super proud of our guys defensively,” said Utah coach Larry Krystkowiak, who also noted that the Utes outrebounded a team that had only been outrebounded three times all season. “We executed pretty well and managed to hang in there and gave ourselves an opportunity to win.”\n",
      "The problem was the Ute offense. Five days after shooting 63% from the field, the Utes shot about half as well, finishing at just 32.7% on the night, the seventh time this season they have shot under 36%. In scoring 52 points, they matched their low output of the year and the result was their eighth loss in 20 games.\n",
      "“We just have to make a couple of more baskets or a couple of more free throws and we’re talking about a different story,” Krystkowiak said.\n",
      "The Utes led by six points at halftime and by nine points with 12:34 left in the game at 40-31. That’s when the Utes went ice cold, going more than six minutes without a basket, allowing the Trojans to take their first lead of the night with a 12-0 run.\n",
      "Krystkowiak lamented one stretch when four different Utes missed “wide-open” shots on one possession as the Utes kept getting rebounds, and came up empty.\n",
      "“I don’t think we were struggling to find offense. I’d prefer to say we had great looks and they didn’t go in,” the Ute coach said. “At the end of the day when you’re playing a game in the 50s, you’ve got to knock a few more of them down.”\n",
      "Utah’s leading scorer on the year, Timmy Allen, who was apparently under the weather, had a rough night, finishing just 5 of 20 from the field and getting blocked on a key drive with under 10 seconds left and the Utes down by two. Also freshman Rylan Jones, who was the hero of Utah’s two wins over Washington and Washington State last week, only made 2 of 9 shots and had six turnovers.\n",
      "Yet the Utes still led the game 52-50 on an Allen basket with 1:04 to play. However, they couldn’t score the rest of the game, as Branden Carlson missed a pair of free throws with 42 seconds left and then Allen had his shot blocked at the end.\n",
      "“It’s disappointing that we lost, but we played our hardest and focused on defense,” said Carlson. “We just didn’t make as many shots as we’d like.”\n",
      "The Utes played without Both Gach, who has been the Utes’ second-leading scorer most of the season but missed the game because of a knee injury, according to Krysktkowiak. Gach suited up, however, and according to his coach, was a “game-time decision,” so he shouldn’t be out long.\n",
      "Freshman Jaxon Brenchley started in Gach’s place and finished with six points and five rebounds in 23 minutes. \n",
      "“Jax played hard — it’s an opportunity for some of our guys to grow a little bit,” said Krystkowiak. “He played some extended minutes was pretty dang solid overall and from a defensive end we certainly didn’t miss anything.” \n",
      "Now it’s over to Pauley Pavilion where the Utes will play a UCLA team that improved to 4-4 in league play with a 72-68 upset of No. 20 Colorado Thursday night. That game tips off at 1 p.m. MT Saturday.\n",
      "Krystkowiak said the Bruins are much like the Trojans with some tough inside players and that the Utes will need to rebound and stop their opponents’ transition.\n",
      "CONCORD, N.H. — John Delaney, the longest-running Democratic candidate in the 2020 presidential race, is ending his campaign after pouring millions of his own money into an effort that failed to resonate with voters.\n",
      "The announcement, made Friday morning, further winnowed down a primary field that had once stood at more than two dozen. \n",
      "“At this moment in time, this is not the purpose God has for me,” Delaney said, in an interview with CNN. “We’ve clearly shaped the debate in a very positive way.”\n",
      "The former Maryland congressman has been running for president since July 2017, though Delaney’s early start did little to give him an advantage in the race or raise his name recognition with Democratic primary voters. \n",
      "In a field dominated by well-known candidates from the liberal wing of the party, Delaney, 56, called for a moderate approach with “real solutions, not impossible promises,” and dubbed the progressive goal of “Medicare for All” to be “political suicide.” \n",
      "Delaney last appeared on the Democratic debate stage in July 2019 but continued to campaign even as his presidential effort largely failed to gain traction. Delaney joins other candidates like Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper who unsuccessfully tried to woo moderate voters before ending their respective campaigns.\n",
      "Campaign finance reports showed Delaney’s campaign was more than $10 million in debt largely because of loans Delaney made to his campaign. At the end of September, months after he had last been on a debate stage, the former lawmaker had just over $548,000 in cash on hand. \n",
      "Before billionaires Tom Steyer and Michael Bloomberg entered the presidential race and used their substantial wealth to gain attention, Delaney tried a similar approach. Back in March, he promised to donate $2 to charity for every new donor who donated on his website. Then in October, Delaney dangled “two club-level” World Series tickets, with hotel and airfare included, as a prize for those that donated to his campaign. \n",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts were frequent targets of Delaney as he warned during the July debate that the “free everything” policy approach would alienate independents and ensure President Donald Trump’s reelection. He compared the two senators to failed Democratic standard-bearers of the past, including George McGovern, Walter Mondale and Michael Dukakis. \n",
      "Delaney renewed that criticism on his way out of the race, saying the true hope for the party lay in moderates like former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. \n",
      "“People like Bernie Sanders who are running on throwing the whole U.S. economy out the window and starting from scratch … I just think that makes our job so much harder, in terms of beating Trump,” Delaney said Friday morning. “I also think that’s not real governing. That’s not responsible leadership because those things aren’t going to happen.” \n",
      "Despite the criticisms, Delaney pledged to “campaign incredibly hard” for whoever won the Democratic nomination. \n",

      "I received mail from the Utah Department of Transportation informing me of charges coming my way because I own an environmentally friendly hybrid vehicle. I get to choose to pay a flat fee or enroll in a usage charge program all based upon the number of miles I drive. By enrolling in the program, I must track my trips, evaluate my driving data and even sort my miles by personal and work trips. Now the government demands to be involved in what I always thought was my private life. What’s next? \n",
      "I presume they feel I don’t pay enough gasoline taxes for my share of the road maintenance costs. Now I must track and collect mileage reports and make payments, or just pay a flat tax. I started wondering about cars that get good gas mileage but aren’t included in this unfair tax. Some gasoline powered cars on our highways get even better gas mileage than I do in my hybrid vehicle, yet they are not being charged this usage fee. \n",
      "How about those that drive very little and yet have the benefit of good roads. Are they entitled to drive on better roads yet not pay for those roads through an additional tax? Do we charge them more because they don’t drive enough? See where this tax is taking us? It can’t be fair. Especially since environmentally friendly vehicles cost more which boosts state tax revenues. \n",
      "Legislature decided that this tax was an acceptable way to increase revenue. This is wrong, it’s unfair and should be rethought and taken off the books. What will it be next time? “How many people ride in your car?” Will the fees for these cars be increased yearly like other taxes now that they have a foot in the door? Looks like we need to be more careful who we vote for. There are too many variables to start singling out and taxing people based on miles per gallon or total miles driven compared to the average. \n",

When you invited me to lunch shortly after my father passed away, I was struggling to find motivation and purpose. Kobe, you brought Gianna with you to spend some time with me. You explained that you wanted to show her that women can be leaders in the NBA, just like the men. At first, it seemed like an action of a devoted father setting an example for his daughter. But in actuality – and I am positively sure you knew EXACTLY what you were doing – what you did was give me the inspiration and strength I was searching for. I reflect on that day often and it makes me smile and it makes me strong. I call on that memory whenever I feel down and need a bit of courage. For everything you did on the court that filled me with so much joy and love, for all the lives you changed through basketball itself, it was that day with Gigi that reignited my drive and determination. Vanessa, Natalia, Bianka, and Capri - I am so sorry for your loss. We are grateful to have you in our lives and we will always be here for you. To the families that also lost loved ones on Sunday, the entire Laker family mourns with you. Laker Nation - we are one family grieving the loss of people we all loved dearly. We will mourn together, cry together but we will also heal together, love together and win TOGETHER. We love you. Kobe - that’s what you made you so unbelievably special. You not only inspired us towards greatness, you showed us the way. \n",

      "SALT LAKE CITY — As the Legislature ends its first week of the 2020 session, a Senate committee is expected to discuss the handling of fetal remains in cases of abortions.\n",
      "Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, is sponsoring SB67, which will be heard by the Senate Health and Human Services Committee Friday afternoon. The bill requires a health care facility having possession of an aborted or miscarried fetus to provide for the final disposition of the fetal remains and requires a health care facility to inform a woman of the options regarding final disposition of an aborted fetus before performing an abortion.\n",
      "In other committee hearings:\n",
      "• Members of the Senate Business and Labor Committee will consider SB31 regarding safety inspections for used vehicles. It was require a car dealer to undergo a safety inspection before issuing a temporary permit for a used vehicle.\n",
      "• The House Government Operations Committee will discuss how to fill congressional vacancies in HB17, which sets rules for temporary appointments for a U.S. Senate seat as well as the special election process for vacant House and Senate seats. One change would move the authority to provide three candidates for temporary senator from a party’s state central committee to the Legislature itself. The governor would then appoint one.\n",
      "• Members of the House Economic Development and Workforce Services Committee are considering HB160 that would create an education program for refugee students within the Refugee Services Office of the Department of Workforce Services. The program would assist adult refugee students who are no longer eligible for traditional high school in obtaining a high school diploma or its equivalent.\n"
