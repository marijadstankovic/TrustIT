# TrustIT 

The goal of this project is to build a fake-news detector.
The project consists of two phases:
- collecting the news from reliable and unreliable sources (folders *ReliableNews* and *UnreliableNews*)
- training a neural network based on the news from previous phase (folder *NN*)

User interface as a final touch: web page (folder *html*) allows users to type in a statement, a sentence or a news text and check what the detector says.
